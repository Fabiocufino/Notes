## Jets and missing transverse momentum

**Reminder**
An event in pp looks like this:

How can we infer the hard scatter objects from the hadrons?
## What is a jet?
![[Pasted image 20240527082047.png|center|500]]

Jets are not physical objects like e, Œº, Œ≥ but rather a tool to understand hadronic activity.
A jet is a collimated bunch of particles formed by the hadronization of quarks and gluons. Jet algorithms are sets of rules used to group stable particles, tracks, and energy deposits in calorimeters to form jets:

**Jet Algorithms**
    - Two main categories: cone algorithms and sequential recombination algorithms.
    - No single "correct" algorithm, but certain criteria like infrared and collinear safety must be fulfilled.

-> An event can look very different depending on the algorithm we use for the grouping, there‚Äôs no ‚Äùcorrect answer‚Äù however certain criteria have to be fulfilled

**Properties of Jet Algorithms**    
    - **Infrared Safety**: The set of jets remains unchanged if a low transverse momentum (pT) gluon emission is added.
    - **Collinear Safety**: The set of jets remains unchanged if an additional collinear (small-angle) splitting occurs.

# Sequential recombination algorithms

#### Define Two Distances

In the context of jet clustering algorithms, two key distances are defined for combining objects (particles or calorimeter cells):

1. **Distance between objects \(i\) and \(j\)**:
   $$
   d_{ij} = \min(p_{T,i}^{2p}, p_{T,j}^{2p}) \frac{\Delta R_{ij}^2}{R^2}
   $$
   - $p_{T,i}$ and $p_{T,j}$ are the transverse momenta of objects $i$ and $j$.
   - $\Delta R_{ij}$ is the distance between objects $i$ and $j$ in the rapidity-azimuth plane.
   - $R$ is the jet radius parameter.

2. **Distance of object $i$ to the beam**:
   $$
   d_{iB} = p_{T,i}^{2p}
   $$
   - This represents how close an object is to being considered a jet on its own, depending on its transverse momentum.
	- A **large $d_{iB}$** suggests the particle has enough transverse momentum to stand alone as a jet.
	- A **small $d_{iB}$‚Äã** indicates that the particle has less transverse momentum and might be grouped with other particles.

#### Jet Algorithms Parameter `p`
- The parameter `p` defines different jet algorithms:
  - \( `p` = 1 \): kt algorithm
  - \( `p` = 0 \): Cambridge/Aachen algorithm
  - \( `p` = -1 \): anti-kt algorithm (focus of this explanation)

#### How to Combine Objects (Anti-kt Algorithm in Action)
1. **Create List of All Input Objects**: Start with a list of particles or calorimeter cells that need to be clustered into jets.

2. **Calculate All Distances \(d_{ij}\) and \(d_{iB}\)**: Compute the pairwise distances between objects and the distances to the beam.

3. **Determine the Minimum Distance**:
   - If $d_{ij} < d_{iB}$:
     - Combine objects $i$ and $j$ into a new object.
     - Recalculate the distances for the new **combined** object and repeat the process.
   - Else if $d_{ij} > d_{iB}$:
     - Declare object $i$ as a jet and remove it from the list.
     - Continue with the remaining objects.

## Jet Definition

- **Radius Parameter \(R\)**:
  - Defines the size of the jets.
  - Common values:
    - Small-R jets: \( R = 0.4 \) (used by ATLAS and CMS for better separation of close jets and reduced pile-up contamination).
    - Large-R jets: \( R = 0.8 \) (CMS) and \( R = 1.0 \) (ATLAS), used for capturing wider-angle emissions, especially in boosted topologies.

- **Recombination Scheme**:
  - Defines how the objects are combined.
  - **E-scheme**: A common method where the four-momentum vectors of the objects are simply added together.

## Anti-kt algorithm in action

We start from all the objects and plot showing preudorapidity v.s. P_t

- Sometimes just one object remains without being clustered to other objects ‚Üí reconstructed as soft jet, typically removed by $p_T$ threshold

- Jets used in analyses: $p_T > 20$ $GeV$ (higher thresholds than for leptons)

## Comparison of sequential recombination algorithms

Anti-kt algorithm is preferred algorithm at the LHC due to cone shape. Shape of the jet is unaffected by soft radiation

- kt algorithm: collects also many soft particles far away from jet axis 
- C/A algorithm: often used to resolve structure within jets


## Jet composition
Jets are complex structures composed of a mix of charged and neutral hadrons, electrons, muons, and photons. 

- The composition typically includes about 2/3 charged particles and 1/3 neutral particles.

Detection systems are specialized to handle this complexity:
- The Inner Detector is optimized for tracking and reconstructing charged particles.
- The Calorimeter can reconstruct both neutral and charged particles, offering detailed energy measurements essential for jet analysis.
![[Pasted image 20240527084639.png|center|300]]
1. **PF Energy Fractions Analysis**: (The fraction of jet energy contributed by different types of particles in the event.)
    - **Charged Hadrons Dominance**: The plot shows that charged hadrons (red area) contribute the largest fraction to the jet energy, which aligns with the expectation that approximately two-thirds of jet constituents are charged particles.
    - **Neutral Hadrons and Photons**: Neutral hadrons (green area) and photons (blue area) also contribute significantly, though less than charged hadrons.
    - **Electrons and Muons**: A small fraction of the jet energy is attributed to electrons and muons (light blue area).
    - **Pileup Contribution**: Charged pileup (brown area) is visible but relatively small, indicating effective pileup mitigation techniques.
    
2. **Data-MC Comparison**:
    - **Consistency Across ùëùùëá‚Äã Range**: The bottom panel shows that the difference between the data and the Monte Carlo simulation remains close to zero across the entire range of $ùëùùëá^{tag}$ ‚Äã, indicating good agreement between the experimental data and the simulation.
    - **Small Deviations**: Minor fluctuations in the Data-MC difference are visible, but they are within acceptable limits, showing that the MC model accurately represents the real data.

## Topological clusters 

1. **Direct Use of Cells in Jet Algorithms:**
   - Cells cannot be directly used as input to jet algorithms because they are too sensitive to noise.  Noise in calorimeter cells can come from various sources including electronic noise and pile-up events (multiple interactions in the same or nearby bunch crossings).

2. **Grouping Cells into Topoclusters:**
   - Cells are grouped into topoclusters based on their significance, represented as $œÇ_{\text{cell}}^{\text{EM}}$. Topoclusters are formed by aggregating adjacent cells that meet the significance criteria. This helps to reduce noise and improve the quality of the data for jet reconstruction.

3. **Cell Significance:**
   - Cell significance is defined as the ratio of the cell‚Äôs energy to the noise. Clustering cells reduces the sensitivity to noise and allows for more accurate jet identification and measurement.
   - The formula for cell significance is:
     $$
     œÇ_{\text{cell}}^{\text{EM}} = \frac{E_{\text{cell}}^{\text{EM}}}{\sigma_{\text{noise, cell}}^{\text{EM}}} = \frac{E_{\text{cell}}^{\text{EM}}}{\sqrt{(\sigma_{\text{electronic noise}})^2 + (\sigma_{\text{pile-up noise}})^2}}
     $$

4. **Categories of Cells Based on Significance (œÇ):**
   - **Seed Cells:** \( \œÇ > 4 \) (Red)
   - **Growth Cells:** \( \œÇ > 2 \) (Orange)
   - **Boundary Cells:** \( \œÇ > 0 \) (Yellow)
   - **Cells from Pile-Up Vertices:** Marked but not defined by specific significance in the diagram (Purple)

![[Pasted image 20240527090210.png|center|300]]

## Pile-up
Pile-up refers to the multiple proton-proton interactions that occur in the same or nearby bunch crossings. This phenomenon significantly affects the data collected by the detector.

Two key metrics related to pile-up are introduced:
- $Œº$, which is the average number of interactions per bunch crossing,
- $N_{PV}$, the number of reconstructed vertices indicating separate interactions.

There are two types of pile-up. 
- **In-time pile-up** refers to simultaneous collisions occurring within the same bunch crossing, which affects the number of reconstructed vertices (N_PV). 
- **Out-of-time pile-up**, on the other hand, involves remnants of signals from previous collisions that affect the current data. This is described by Œº and is relevant due to the readout time of detector components such as the ATLAS LAr (Electromagnetic) calorimeter.

Pile-up can have various effects on jet reconstruction. It can lead to additional jets from pile-up vertices, which complicates the analysis. Additionally, pile-up contributes extra energy to hard-scatter jets, making it harder to accurately measure their energy and properties.

![[Pasted image 20240527090538.png|center|700]]

One plot shows the recorded luminosity as a function of the mean number of interactions per crossing for different years, indicating how pile-up conditions vary over time. 

Another graph shows the average number of reconstructed vertices versus the average number of interactions per bunch crossing, demonstrating the efficiency of vertex reconstruction. 

Lastly, a diagram illustrates the shape of the detector pulse and the shaped and sampled signal over time, highlighting how out-of-time pile-up can affect signal measurement.


## Particle Flow
Particle Flow combines tracking information with calorimeter measurements to improve jet reconstruction

![[Pasted image 20240527091149.png|center|600]]

The graph on the slide illustrates the resolution of ùëùùëá‚Äã as a function of ùëùùëá (in GeV) at ùúÇ=0. It shows that tracking detectors (represented by green squares) have superior resolution at lower ùëùùëá, whereas calorimeters (represented by blue stars) outperform tracking detectors at higher ùëùùëá. This crossover demonstrates the complementary strengths of tracking detectors and calorimeters in measuring particle momenta across a wide range of energies.

Summary: for charged particle you switch and for neutral you cannot.

In the Particle Flow algorithm, the energy deposited in the calorimeter by charged particles is subtracted from topoclusters to avoid double counting. This energy is then replaced by the track momenta of these particles. Essentially, this means that the momentum measurements from the tracking detectors are used in place of the calorimetric energy measurements for charged particles. 

-> This substitution is important because track momenta are typically more precise than calorimeter energy measurements for charged particles.

## Charged Hadron Subtraction (CHS)

Charged Hadron Subtraction is a technique to mitigate the effects of pile-up, which can introduce additional noise and complicate data analysis.

- **Remove Tracks Associated with Pile-Up Vertices (PU):** After subtracting the energy contribution of charged particles from the calorimeter, all tracks that are associated with pile-up vertices are removed. This step helps to clean the data by eliminating contributions from interactions that are not related to the primary collision of interest.
    
- **Add Tracks Associated with Hard Scatter (HS):** Only tracks associated with the hard scatter vertices (the primary collision of interest) are added back into the list of inputs for further analysis. This ensures that the remaining tracks are relevant to the event being studied.

## Small-R Calibration Chain
- The calibration chain used for small-R jets in the ATLAS experiment is essentially the same as in the CMS experiment but with slightly different names for the various steps.

![[Pasted image 20240606113146.png|center|600]]

## JES/JER
- **Jet Energy Scale (JES):**
  - The response (R) is defined as $R = \frac{E_{reco}}{E_{truth}}$
  - Matching of truth and reconstructed jets is done via ŒîR.
  - Response is roughly Gaussian distributed.
  - \($R \approx 1$ \): Indicates that the reconstructed jet energy corresponds on average to the truth jet energy.
  - This match is not the case without dedicated calibrations.

- **Jet Energy Resolution (JER):**
  - Measures the width of the jet energy response distribution.
  - For a perfect detector, the distribution would be a delta-function.

![[Pasted image 20240606113301.png|center|400]]

## Origin-Correction
- Jets are corrected to the hard scatter vertex instead of the center of the detector.
- Jet calibrations are derived in bins of $\eta_{det}$
- The impact of this correction is illustrated by comparing the reconstructed and truth jet $p_T$ values with and without the origin correction.
![[Pasted image 20240606113331.png|center|500]]


## Pile-Up Corrections - $p_T$ - Density Based Correction
- Utilizes the fact that pile-up contributions are equally distributed in the detector. ![[Pasted image 20240606113431.png|center|300]]
![[Pasted image 20240606113450.png|center|400]]

- Approximately 0.2 GeV per NPV (number of primary vertices) is added to the transverse momentum of R = 0.4 jets in the central region.
