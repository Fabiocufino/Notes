• Write down all possible signatures of Z-boson pair production
![[Pasted image 20240604103443.png|center|400]]

• Which one will most likely not be observed?
- 4 neutrinos.

• Hints:
	• Hint 1: Z-bosons decays can decay into pairs of charged leptons, neutrinos or quarks

If you have to look at an easy decay you should look at $ee\mu\mu$

## Total Cross Sections

##### Trigger
• Too large amount of data arriving at the detectors
	• Pre-select only “interesting” events (sub-percent level)
	• Defines which data is stored and which is thrown away!
• Considerations:
	• Hardware vs. software trigger
	• Simple vs. complex selection (process-specific selection or most general selection?)
	• Fight for trigger bandwidth (which process is most important?)

##### Event Selection
Events are selected based on their signatures, such as the presence of a certain number of charged leptons and jets. The selection criteria must strike a balance:
- if too loose, it can lead to an abundance of background noise;
- if too stringent, it might result in insufficient statistical data.
Effective event selection includes showing event yields and control plots to ensure the integrity and relevance of the selected data.

##### Background Estimate
Certain processes can mimic the signal process, making it challenging to distinguish between them. These processes either share the same final state or have a similar signature with misidentified objects.

For example, in the search for a new resonance like the Z' boson, the signal might be identified by two high-pT electrons. However, backgrounds such as Z bosons decaying into electrons and W+jets events (where one electron is correctly identified and one jet is misidentified as an electron) can complicate the analysis.

#### Strategies for Background Estimation
To accurately estimate backgrounds, two main strategies are employed:

1. **Monte Carlo Simulations:**
   - These simulations are particularly effective for well-understood Standard Model (SM) processes. They provide a controlled environment to predict how different processes might appear in the detector.

2. **Data-Driven Methods:**
   - These methods are used for estimating backgrounds involving misidentified objects and Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD) processes. By using real data, these methods account for discrepancies that might not be fully captured in simulations.

## Estimating Signal Events

To estimate the number of signal events, one can use simple cut-and-count analyses or fit a model to kinematic distributions. More complex tools for classification are applied when distributions and correlations are well-understood:

- Fit a model to a kinematic distribution
	- OK for signal for well-understood background
- Apply complex tools for classification
	- OK if distributions and correlations are understood

**Efficiency and Acceptance Estimation**
Estimating efficiencies and acceptances involves determining the probability of detecting and correctly identifying events. Methods can be based on Monte Carlo simulations, particularly for Standard Model processes like vector-boson production, or on data from background-enriched samples for specific cases like photon efficiencies. Propagating uncertainties through these estimations is crucial, and the process requires careful mathematical handling to avoid significant errors.


**Estimation of uncertainties**
• Consider potential sources of uncertainty.
• How uncertain are the inputs?
• Propagate uncertainty to final result, be careful with the math.
• Sometimes: consider uncertainties in the statistical model and associate uncertainties with nuisance parameters.
• No clear recipes for systematic uncertainties.

## Measurement Concepts: Fiducial Cross Sections

**Total Cross Section**

The total cross section involves a significant extrapolation from the observable phase space (the data we can actually measure) to the total phase space (the theoretical full range of possible outcomes). This extrapolation is typically around a few percent, introducing potential errors and uncertainties.

**Fiducial Region**
To address these **issues**, we define a fiducial region in phase space. This region is a specific subset of the total phase space where measurements are made and results are quoted. This approach has both advantages and disadvantages:

- **Pro**: By focusing only on the fiducial region, we avoid the large extrapolations needed for total cross section measurements, reducing associated uncertainties.
- **Con**: Results obtained in the fiducial phase space are not as easily comparable with theoretical predictions or results from other experiments that might use different fiducial definitions.

**Illustration of Phase Spaces**
![[Pasted image 20240608161738.png|center|300]]

- **Total Phase Space**: The complete range of possible outcomes in an experiment.
- **Observable Phase Space**: The subset of the total phase space that we can directly measure with our detectors.
- **Fiducial Phase Space**: A specific, well-defined region within the observable phase space where the measurements are made and results are reported.


##### Differential cross sections
-  Extend the concept to distributions in one or several variables, e.g. transverse momentum or pseudorapidity.

**BUT**:
-  Measured distribution is sometimes shifted and the shift might depend on the variable itself, e.g. a momentum-dependent acceptance for charged leptons

Example: Energy Resolution

Depending on the detector the results change a lot.On the left there is a lot of detector inside because for sure it's not the true distribution. Somehow we have to remove the detector effects, simulating the detetor effects and remove this part: **unfolding**

![[Pasted image 20240608162125.png|center|400]]

**Unfolding the Distribution**

Unfolding corrects the observed data to represent the true physical quantities, accounting for detector resolutions and efficiencies. This is necessary because the raw data collected by detectors is influenced by these factors, potentially distorting the true underlying distribution.

Unfolding is an ill-posed problem, meaning there is no unique solution. Various algorithms and tools are available to perform this task, each with its own advantages and limitations. The choice of method can significantly impact the results, making careful consideration essential.

Several key factors must be considered during the unfolding process:

- **Bin Size**: The choice of bin size can affect the resolution and sensitivity of the unfolded distribution.
- **Correlations Among Bins**: Understanding and accounting for correlations between bins is crucial to avoid misleading results.
- **Interpretation**: Careful interpretation of the unfolded results is necessary to ensure they accurately represent the true physical quantities.

**Migration Matrix**

A migration matrix is required to relate the reconstructed data (as measured by the detector) to the true data (the actual physical quantities). This matrix is used to correct for the detector effects and is derived from simulations.

**Simple Bin-by-Bin Corrections**

In the simplest case, bin-by-bin corrections can be applied. This method works well for distributions that are not steep and have small correlations among bins. It involves correcting each bin individually without considering the correlations with other bins.

For the trigger we use a single-electron or a single-muon trigger
- Connect both with a logical “OR”
### Detailed Example: Event Selection and Yield

## Event Selection Criteria

In this detailed example, the event selection criteria are specified to identify events of interest in a particle physics experiment. The criteria are:

- **Lepton Selection**: Exactly one electron and one muon of opposite electric charge.
- **Jet Requirements**: At least two jets must be present in the event.
- **b-tagged Jet**: One of the jets must be identified as a b-jet (b-tagged).
- **Missing Transverse Momentum**: There are no specific requirements on missing transverse momentum.

**Event Yield**
The table summarizes the expected and observed event yields for different processes in the signal region. The processes considered include:
![[Pasted image 20240608162753.png|center|300]]

The total expected yield is 17,000 ± 900 events, while the observed yield is 17,501 events.

**Control Plots Analysis**
Control plots are essential tools in particle physics experiments for validating the event selection, background estimation, and overall analysis process. These plots compare the observed data with predictions from the Standard Model (SM) and help in identifying any discrepancies that might indicate the presence of new physics or the need for adjustments in the analysis.

**Description** 
The provided control plots from the ATLAS experiment at $\sqrt{s} = 13 \text{ TeV}$ and an integrated luminosity of $3.2 \text{ fb}^{-1}$ display various distributions:

1. **Top Left Plot**: Distribution of the transverse momentum (\(p_T\)) of electrons.
2. **Top Right Plot**: Distribution of the missing transverse energy ($E_T^{\text{miss}}$).
3. **Bottom Left Plot**: Distribution of the transverse momentum ($p_T$) of the top quark candidate.
4. **Bottom Right Plot**: Distribution of the invariant mass ($m(t\ell)$) of the top quark and lepton system.

Each plot includes:
- **Data (black points)**: The actual events observed in the detector.
- **Background Contributions**: Colored histograms representing different background processes:
  - **Single top (blue)**
  - **Fake lepton (yellow)**
  - **Diboson (red)**
  - **Drell-Yan (\(\tau\tau\)) (purple)**
  - **\(t\bar{t}\) (open histogram)**
- **Statistical and Systematic Uncertainties (gray bands)**: Indicate the level of uncertainty in the predictions.

![[Pasted image 20240608163223.png|center|500]]

**Electron \(p_T\) Distribution (Left)**

The electron $p_T$ distribution shows the number of events as a function of the transverse momentum of the detected electrons. The data points are compared to the predicted contributions from various background processes. The overall agreement between the observed data and the predicted backgrounds suggests that the electron \(p_T\) is well-modeled. The lower panel shows the ratio of predicted to observed events, which should ideally be close to one. Small deviations within the uncertainty bands indicate the robustness of the prediction.

**Missing Transverse Energy $E_T^{\text{miss}}$ Distribution (Right)**

This plot displays the distribution of missing transverse energy that can indicate the presence of undetected particles such as neutrinos. The observed data matches the predicted backgrounds well, confirming that the missing energy is correctly accounted for. The lower panel ratio helps identify any systematic biases in the missing energy measurement.

**Top Quark \(p_T\) Distribution (Left)**

The \(p_T\) distribution of the top quark candidate provides insight into the kinematic properties of the events. The agreement between observed and predicted distributions supports the accuracy of the event reconstruction and the background estimation processes. The lower panel again shows the predicted to observed ratio, helping to verify the consistency of the model.

**Invariant Mass $m(t\ell)$ Distribution (Right)**

The invariant mass distribution of the top quark and lepton system is crucial for identifying potential resonances and verifying the mass reconstruction techniques. The data aligns well with the predictions, suggesting that the mass reconstruction is reliable. Deviations, if any, in the lower panel ratio are within the expected uncertainties, reinforcing the robustness of the analysis.

## Unfolding

The observed spectrum is unfolded using an iterative Bayesian method, a technique that corrects the data for detector effects to approximate the true distribution of the measured quantity. This process is validated using toy Monte Carlo simulations to ensure internal consistency. The migration matrices used in unfolding, which describe how events migrate between different bins due to detector resolution and efficiency, are derived from simulations.

### Migration Matrices

The migration matrices from the ATLAS simulation illustrate the unfolding process for two variables: the transverse momentum of the top quark candidate ($p_T(t)$) and the invariant mass of the top quark and lepton system ($m(t\ell)$).

- **p_T(t) Migration Matrix**: This matrix shows the probability of an event in a true $p_T$​ bin being reconstructed in a different bin. The diagonal elements represent events that are correctly reconstructed, while the off-diagonal elements indicate migrations to other bins. Higher values along the diagonal indicate better resolution and reconstruction fidelity.
- **m(tℓ)m(t\ell)m(tℓ) Migration Matrix**: Similarly, this matrix depicts the migration probabilities for the invariant mass of the top quark and lepton system, providing insight into the necessary corrections for the mass measurement.
