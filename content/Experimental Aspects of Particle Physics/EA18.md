# **Electroweak Precision Measurements**

## Exercise: How can the Weinberg angle be measured?

Reminder: Photon and Z couplings

- From the SU(2) x U(1) symmetry follows: $Q = T_3  + Y/2$
- From the mixing of the neutral gauge bosons follows![[Pasted image 20240706154751.png|center|400]]
**Questions 1:** Which bosons couple how to LH and RH fermions?
- $\gamma$ - Equally to LH and RH
- Z - Not equally to LH and RH
- W - Only to LH

## **Forward-backward asymmetry**
- Consider a process $ee \rightarrow f \bar{f}$![[Pasted image 20240706155022.png|center|400]]
- cross section for $2\rightarrow 2$ processes depend only on two variables, e.g. $d\Omega$

The differential cross section fro the process is

If we do some math we can rewrite the cross section as
![[Pasted image 20240706155428.png|center|500]]
with ![[Pasted image 20240706155447.png|center|500]]
To calculate the total cross section we have to integrate over the variables ![[Pasted image 20240706155606.png|center|200]]
Then![[Pasted image 20240706155645.png|center|500]]
We can also compute the ratio to the pure photon cross section:
$$
R_\mu = \frac{\sigma_{tot}}{\sigma_{QED}}
$$
For the sigma just computed we can see that the ration is

![[Pasted image 20240706155953.png|center|600]]
- one could use the total cross section at the pole to infer on the Weinberg angle, but an absolute measurement is experimentally difficult

So we know the differential cross section and from that we can integrate over different intervals. WE can define then the forward and backward cross section and compute the Forward-Backward asimmetry.

The forward-backward asymmetry is defined as
$$
A_{FB} = \frac{\sigma_F - \sigma_B}{\sigma_F + \sigma_B}
$$

We can now calculate the asymmetry as a function of ùêπ1(ùë†) and ùêπ2(ùë†) for the production of muon pairs and see how it's large in the Z-pole:

But still: How can the Weinberg angle be determined from a measurement of the asymmetries?

**Use the definitions of $C_V$ and $C_A$**
