‚Ä¢ Basic experimental methods in accelerator-based particle physics; interpretation of the data; methods of conducting data analysis including data preparation, physics objects, statistical modelling and the treatment of systematic uncertainties; phenomenology of different processes and recent experimental results including searches for new phenomena, precision measurements as well as an overview of current and future experiments.

## Particle-physics laboratories
There are many physics laboratories all around the world: Fermilab: Tevatron, SLAC: PEP (II), DESY: PETRA, DORIS (II), HERA, CERN: SPPS, LEP, LHC, KEK: (Super-)KEKB, Cornell: CESR
The most important by far is LHC at CERN.

**1978 ‚Äì Stochastic cooling**
This revolutionary technique involved using random fluctuations in a particle beam's momentum to improve its focus and stability. By employing sophisticated technologies and precise control mechanisms, scientists were able to enhance the performance of particle accelerators significantly.

**1983 ‚Äì Discovery of the Z/W bosons**
In 1983, a milestone discovery occurred at CERN with the detection of the Z and W bosons, fundamental particles responsible for the weak nuclear force. This breakthrough, confirmed through experiments conducted at the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) collider 300 GeV protons
and anti-protons, validated the electroweak theory. 
Noble prize to Carlo Rubbia and Simon Van der Meer in 1984.

**1989 ‚Äì Number of light neutrinos**
The discovery happened at LEP: electron-positron collider operating at 90 GeV and more. Four experiments were involved: ALEPH, Delphi, L3, OPAL.

**1995 ‚Äì Production of antihydrogen**
The production of antihydrogen represents a significant achievement in the realm of particle physics. Antihydrogen is the antimatter counterpart of hydrogen, consisting of an antiproton and a positron (the anti-electron) bound together. This process typically involves creating antiprotons in particle accelerators and then slowing them down to trap them using magnetic fields. Positrons are subsequently introduced and cooled to very low temperatures before being brought into proximity with the trapped antiprotons. Through carefully controlled interactions, antihydrogen atoms are formed.
Production of 9 anti-hydrogen atoms in the 1995.

**2012 ‚Äì Discovery of the Higgs boson**
