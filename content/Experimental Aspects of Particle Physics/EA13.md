## b-tagging

**Key Features of b-hadrons:**
- **Lifetime:** Approximately 1.5 picoseconds (ps), leading to decays that are displaced from the hard scatter (HS) vertex.
- **Mass and Decay:** b-hadrons have a high mass and high decay multiplicity.

**Low-level Algorithms:**
- **Impact Parameter Algorithms:** These algorithms, such as IP3D, utilize the impact parameter to help identify b-jets.
- **Secondary Vertex Finding Algorithms:** Algorithms like SV1 are used to locate secondary vertices, which are indicative of b-hadron decays.

**High-level Algorithms:**
- **Machine Learning (ML) Based Taggers:** These taggers use jet kinematics and input from various low-level algorithms to improve b-jet identification.

- **Tracks (in purple and green):** Indicate the paths of particles.
- **b hadron (in pink):** Represents the b-hadron traveling from the primary vertex to the secondary vertex.

- **b-jet (in blue):** The cone represents the jet containing the b-hadron, showing the separation between light jets and b-jets based on the secondary vertex.


**b-tagging performance**
The performance of b-tagging algorithms is evaluated and supported for working points typically corresponding to signal efficiencies ranging between 60% and 85%.

Graphs are provided to illustrate the b-jet tagging efficiency and the rejection rates for light-flavour jets and c-jets. These metrics are compared for various b-tagging algorithms, including:

- MV2
- DL1 (the best)
- IP3D {based on the impact parameter)
- SV1 (secondary vertex algorithm)
- JetFitter

The first set of graphs shows the efficiency and the ratio to the MV2 algorithm across different b-tagging efficiencies, demonstrating how different algorithms compare in performance. 

The second set of graphs shows the light-flavour jet and c-jet rejection rates as a function of b-jet tagging efficiency, illustrating the effectiveness of each algorithm in distinguishing b-jets from other types of jets.

**b-tagging calibration**
The efficiency of the b-tagging algorithm can differ between data and Monte Carlo (MC) simulation. To address this, the efficiency in MC is calibrated to match the efficiency observed in data, often using events from top-antitop (tt̄) decays as a reference. The uncertainties in this calibration process are predominantly due to the modelling of signal processes within the MC simulation. At high transverse momentum (pT), the calibration relies on MC simulation to extrapolate uncertainties.

The graph shows the relationship between jet pT and the b-tagging efficiency scale factor, highlighting that scale factors are provided for various b-tagging working points (e.g., 60%, 70%, 77%, and 85% efficiency). These scale factors are critical for correcting differences between data and simulation, ensuring accurate b-tagging performance in physics analyses.

The calibration accounts for the total uncertainty, including statistical and systematic components, and provides a smoothed, extrapolated scale factor for high pT regions where direct data measurements might be sparse. This calibration process is essential for accurate identification of b-jets in particle physics experiments.

## Missing transverse momentum

**Definition and Notation:**
- MET, also known as missing $E_T$, $E_T^{miss}$, $p_T^{miss}$, represents missing transverse momentum but **not** missing transverse energy.
- Formula: $$ \vec{p}_T^{miss} = - \sum_{\text{particles}} \vec{p}_T = - \left( \sum_{\text{hard obj}} \vec{p}_T + \sum_{\text{soft}} \vec{p}_T \right) $$
-> Why momentum and not energy? Because we don't know the energy of the incoming proton that well.

**Terms of the equation:**
- **Hard Objects:** Includes electrons, jets, muons, etc.
- **Soft Term:** Refers to energy deposits not associated with any hard objects. It is crucial to exclude pile-up contributions from this term.

**Overlap Removal:**
- Critical to avoid double counting objects. For example, electrons might be reconstructed as jets.

**Real and Fake MET:**
- **Real MET:** Can be due to neutrinos or new physics phenomena.
- **Fake MET:** Often a result of mismeasurement.

## Soft term

**Definition and Collection:**
- The soft term collects all components not associated with hard objects.
  - Examples include jets not passing the threshold criteria and tracks not associated with any object.

**Types of Soft Terms:**

1. **Cluster Soft Term (CST):**
   - Includes both charged and neutral components.
   - Sensitive to pile-up, which means it requires further suppression of pile-up effects at the cluster level.

2. **Track Soft Term (TST):**
   - Includes only charged components.
   - More robust against pile-up compared to CST.

![[Pasted image 20240528110619.png|center|400]]

- The graph compares the Root Mean Square (RMS) of \(E_T^{miss}\) for CST and TST as a function of the number of reconstructed vertices (NPV).
- CST shows a significant increase in RMS with increasing NPV, indicating higher sensitivity to pile-up.
- TST remains relatively stable across varying NPV, demonstrating better pile-up resistance.
- The lower part of the graph shows the Data/MC ratio, which indicates how well the data matches the Monte Carlo simulation for both CST and TST methods.

## Large-R jets for heavy object decays

**Context and Importance:**
- At the Large Hadron Collider (LHC), heavy objects such as W, Z, H, and top quarks are frequently produced with transverse momentum (\(p_T\)) significantly greater than their mass (\(m\)).
- These high \(p_T\) conditions cause the decay products to become collimated, leading to overlapping hadrons.

**Rule of Thumb:**
- The angular separation (\(\Delta R\)) between decay products can be approximated by $$\Delta R \approx \frac{2m}{p_T}$$
**Reconstruction Strategy:**
- To manage these overlapping decay products, it is more effective to reconstruct them within one large-radius jet instead of multiple small-radius jets.
- Large-R jets typically have a radius parameter $R = 1.0$.

**Illustrations:**

![[Pasted image 20240528110836.png|center|500]]

- **Resolved Decay:** When \(p_T\) of the object \(X\) is much less than its mass (\(m_X\)), the decay products (A and B) are separated and can be reconstructed using small-radius jets (\(R = 0.4\)).
- **Boosted Decay:** When \(p_T\) is much greater than \(m_X\), the decay products are collimated and should be reconstructed using a large-radius jet (\(R = 1.0\)).


The graph on the right shows the relationship between $p_T$ and the angular separation $\Delta R$ for the decay products of a top quark (t) into W boson and b-quark (t → Wb) in a simulated ATLAS experiment. The color gradient indicates the density of events, with higher densities shown in warmer colors (red, orange).


**Jet substructure**
- Study the inner structure to distinguish signal large-R jets (top, W, Z, H) from background jets (quark/gluon-initiated)

- Requires precise reconstruction of energy deposits in the calorimeter (and removal of energy deposits from pile-up)

![[Pasted image 20240528111036.png|center|500]]


## Impact of pile-up on large-R jet mass
- The jet mass varies significantly with pile-up and the resolution diminishes with $\mu$
- Jet grooming algorithms: remove wide-angle and soft radiation and pile-up effects

![[Pasted image 20240528111200.png]]

This is the proof that is working 

![[Pasted image 20240528111319.png|center|400]]

**Jet substructure information**
Define variables that are sensitive to differences between q/g jets vs. W/Z/H/top jet

*Jet mass:*
- Jet containing heavy object decay: mJ = mheavy object 
- Quark/gluon jet: mJ ≈ 0

*N-subjettiness: pronginess*
- Jet containing e.g. top quark decay: expect three prongs
- Quark/gluon jet: expect one prong (+ prongs from radiation)

## Algorithm of jet reconstruction: Cambridge-Aachen reclustering
The Cambridge-Aachen algorithm is a **sequential recombination algorithm** that clusters objects based on their **geometric distance** in the detector space. Unlike the k_t​ or anti-k_tk]​ algorithms, it does not consider the transverse momentum (p_T​) in the distance metric, focusing solely on the angular separation. $$
     d_{ij} = \Delta R_{ij}^2 = (\eta_i - \eta_j)^2 + (\phi_i - \phi_j)^2
     $$

  - **Top Images:** Two different stages are shown:
    - In the **first step (top-left)**, the algorithm finds the closest pair of objects (1 and 2) and merges them.
    - In the **second step (top-right)**, the next closest pair of objects (the merged object from step 1 and another object) is combined.
- The process continues iteratively, combining the objects that are closest together in (η,ϕ) space until all are merged into a single jet.

## Multivariate Taggers
- Use substructure variables to improve jet tagging.
  - **Jet Mass and N-subjettiness:**
    - Combined using:
      - Deep Neural Networks (DNN)
      - Boosted Decision Trees (BDT)
    - These methods offer better background rejection compared to traditional cuts on individual variables.
  ![[Pasted image 20240606122942.png|center|600]]

#### Shaping of the Jet Mass

- Improved performance with multivariate taggers can lead to the significant shaping of the jet mass for background events.
  - This is not ideal for searches for new physics as it can affect the mass distribution.

#### Event Display

- Illustrates typical event displays to show the application of jet algorithms and substructure techniques in data.
  ![[Pasted image 20240606123006.png|center|400]]
#### Towards Higher Momenta

- At very high momenta, decay products of objects like the W boson are very collimated.

- **Two-Prong Structure:**
  - Cannot be resolved at high momenta.
  
- **Improved Angular Resolution:**
  - Use charged-particle tracks to improve resolution.
  - Clusters are split into N clusters if N tracks point to them.
