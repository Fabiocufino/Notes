I really don't know what happened this day.

Here an overview
## **Efficiency Estimates**

- **Trigger Efficiency Estimation:**
  - The trigger efficiency ($\hat{\epsilon}(T)$) is estimated as:$$
  \hat{\epsilon}(T) = \frac{m_T}{m_A}
  $$
  where:
  - $m_T$: Number of triggered events.
  - $m_A$: Number of reconstructed events.

- **Uncertainty Estimation:**
  - To find the uncertainty in efficiency estimation, we must consider the distribution of events:
  - **Poisson Distribution:** Used when there is an expected value, and events are counted.
  - **Binomial Distribution:** Applied here because we have a probability (not an expected value) for a number of successes in a series of trials.
    - Probability distribution for  $m_T$ given efficiency $\epsilon(T)$ and $m_A$:
    $$
    P(m_T | \epsilon(T), m_A) = \frac{m_A!}{m_T! \, (m_A - m_T)!} \cdot \epsilon^{m_T} (1 - \epsilon)^{m_A - m_T}
    $$
    - This represents the maximum likelihood estimator for efficiency.

- **Uncertainty Formula:**
  $$
  \hat{\sigma}[\hat{\epsilon}] = \sqrt{V[\hat{\epsilon}]} = \sqrt{\frac{\hat{\epsilon} (1 - \hat{\epsilon})}{m_A}}
  $$
  Plugging in the estimated efficiency:
  $$
  \hat{\sigma}[\hat{\epsilon}] = \sqrt{\frac{m_T (m_A - m_T)}{m_A^3}}
  $$
  - **Note:** If $\epsilon = 1$, then $\hat{\sigma} = 0$ , which indicates a problem because it suggests zero uncertainty, which isn't realistic in all scenarios. This method works well for most efficiencies but may not be reliable for extreme values.

## **Tag-and-Probe Method:**

A method used to estimate efficiency in an unbiased way, often using data directly rather than relying solely on simulations.
 - **Steps:**
   1. **Tag Sample:** Select a clean subset of events with known properties (tag).
  2. **Probe Sample:** Use this tag to probe the efficiency of detecting certain events.
- This method helps determine the efficiency of a detector or an analysis algorithm in identifying true events.

## **Estimating Contributions of Processes to a Dataset**
The goal is to estimate the number of events from different sources (signal and background) in the dataset.

- **Matrix Method for Estimating Contributions:**
  - The Matrix Method uses statistical techniques to separate signal from background in datasets where multiple sources of events are present.
  
- **Matrix Method Details:**
  1. **Without Background:**
     - For a dataset containing only signal events, the estimated number of events is given by:
     $$
     \hat{V}(S) = \epsilon_S \cdot V_S
     $$
     where:
     - \( \hat{V}(S) \): Estimated number of signal events.
     - \( \epsilon_S \): Efficiency of detecting signal events.
     - \( V_S \): Actual number of signal events.

  2. **With Background:**
     - When background sources are present, the equation becomes:
     $$
     V(S) = \epsilon_{S} V_{S} + \epsilon_{S, B_1} V_{B_1} + \epsilon_{S, B_2} V_{B_2} + \cdots + \epsilon_{S, B_m} V_{B_m}
     $$
     where:
     - $V(S)$: Observed total number of signal-like events.
     - $\epsilon_{S}$: Efficiency for true signal events.
     - $\epsilon_{S, B_i}$: Efficiency for detecting background source $B_i$  as signal.
     - $V_{B_i}$: Number of events from background source $i$ 

  3. **Matrix Formulation:**
     - The set of linear equations can be expressed in matrix form:
     $$
     \mathbf{V} = \mathbf{E} \cdot \mathbf{N}
     $$
     where:
     $$
     \mathbf{V} = 
     \begin{pmatrix}
     V(S) \\
     V(B_1) \\
     \vdots \\
     V(B_m)
     \end{pmatrix}, \quad
     \mathbf{E} = 
     \begin{pmatrix}
     \epsilon_{S} & \epsilon_{S, B_1} & \cdots & \epsilon_{S, B_m} \\
     \epsilon_{B_1, S} & \epsilon_{B_1, B_1} & \cdots & \epsilon_{B_1, B_m} \\
     \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
     \epsilon_{B_m, S} & \epsilon_{B_m, B_1} & \cdots & \epsilon_{B_m, B_m}
     \end{pmatrix}, \quad
     \mathbf{N} =
     \begin{pmatrix}
     V_S \\
     V_{B_1} \\
     \vdots \\
     V_{B_m}
     \end{pmatrix}
     $$
     - Solving this matrix equation allows the determination of \( V_S \), \( V_{B_1} \), ..., \( V_{B_m} \), which represent the contributions of the signal and different background sources.

## Template Method
A technique to estimate parameters by comparing observed data to a set of predefined "templates" (histograms or distributions) that represent the expected outcomes for different parameter values.
