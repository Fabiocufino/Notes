# Direct searches for new physics

all measurements at the LHC and other collider experiments: → in good agreement with SM

thats good news... right? Not quite!

There are several things that the SM does not describe/explain:

→ does not provide a DM candidate  
→ does not explain matter/antimatter asymmetry  
→ does not include neutrino masses  
→ does not describe strong and EW unification  
→ lack of CP violation in QCD (strong CP problem)  
→ gravity not included, fine-tuning problem, hierarchy problem...

## The many free parameters of the Standard Model

**3. Hierarchy/Fine-Tuning Problem**

- The **Higgs mass** $m_H = 125.09 \, \text{GeV}$ is significantly smaller than the **Planck scale** $(M_{\text{Planck}} \sim 10^{19} \, \text{GeV}$)
- The problem arises when we consider the large separation between the electroweak scale, where the Higgs mass is measured, and the higher energy scales like the **Grand Unified Theory (GUT) scale** $\sim 10^{16} \, \text{GeV}$ or the Planck scale.
- This enormous difference in scales suggests that the Higgs mass should receive large quantum corrections (loop corrections) from particles with masses at those high-energy scales.



The Higgs mass receives **loop corrections** due to quantum fluctuations. These corrections come from:
  1. **Self-interactions** (Higgs field interacting with itself).
  2. **Gauge loops** (interactions with gauge bosons, like \(W\) and \(Z\)).
  3. **Fermion loops** (interactions with fermions like top quarks).

- The mass squared of the Higgs can be written as:
  $$
  M_H^2 = M_{H, \text{bare}}^2 + \delta M_H^2
  $$
  where $M_{H, \text{bare}}^2$ is the bare Higgs mass before quantum corrections, and $\delta M_H^2$ is the correction from loops.

- These corrections are **quadratically divergent** at high energy scales, meaning they grow larger with the cutoff scale $\Lambda$. If $\Lambda$ is chosen to be near the Planck scale $M_{\text{Planck}}$, then $\delta M_H^2$  becomes much larger than the observed Higgs mass $m_H^2$. This results in the **fine-tuning problem**, where we would have to cancel out these large corrections with extreme precision to maintain a low Higgs mass.

  **Implication:**
  - This situation indicates that the Standard Model alone is insufficient to explain why the Higgs mass is stable at the electroweak scale and does not blow up due to quantum corrections. Many **Beyond the Standard Model (BSM)** theories, such as supersymmetry, have been proposed to solve this issue by introducing new particles or mechanisms that cancel out these large corrections.
