## Reconstruction of tracks
Let's do a review of the atlas inner detector

**The Silicon Pixel Detector**, with pixel sizes of 50×400 μm², achieves a resolution of 10×115 μm² across its vast array of 80 million readout channels.  

**The Silicon Strip Detector**, featuring strip sizes of 6cm×80 μm (long pixel), achieves a resolution of 17 μm, utilizing 6 million readout channels. 

**Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT)** utilizes straw tubes with a diameter of 4 mm, yielding a resolution of 130 μm over its 350 thousand readout channels. 

Such detector configurations enable precise spatial localization and tracking of particles within the ATLAS inner detector.

Now we talk about the track reconstruction.

**Step 1: The Inside-out Algorithm** initiates the track reconstruction process by efficiently identifying primary charged particles. It starts with the seeding of three hits within the silicon detectors. These hits are then progressively augmented while moving away from the Interaction Point (IP) using a Kalman filter, which optimally estimates the particle's trajectory. This iterative process enables the extrapolation of particle paths to the Transition Radiation Tracker (TRT), aiding in their identification and localization.

**Step 2: Back-tracking** serves as the second stage, primarily focused on identifying secondary particles. Starting from the tracks detected in the TRT, this technique traces the particle trajectories backward to the silicon detectors. By retracing their paths, it facilitates the identification of particles generated from subsequent interactions, thereby enhancing the completeness of the reconstruction process.

**Step 3: The final step** involves the utilization of TRT-only tracks. This stage further refines the reconstruction process by exclusively considering tracks detected within the Transition Radiation Tracker. 

Throughout these sequential steps, the efficiency of track reconstruction is rigorously evaluated using Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

This is a simulation of the primary efficiency as a $p_T$ of the tracks, here we check the $\mu$ that is the *average number of primary vertices*. It is rather constant and it's good that this do not depend on mu.
Roughly we have 80%

## Kalman filter
- Iterative and local procedure: Start with seed position. Predict position of next measurement. Perform next measurement and merge (filter) prediction and measurement.
- Apply some sort of smoothing. Repeat until all measurements have been performed.
- Filter: weighted average ![[Pasted image 20240514104146.png|center|300]]where 𝑦𝑛 is the new measurement, 𝑦𝑝 is the prediction.

During the track reconstruction process employing the Kalman filter, certain criteria govern the handling of measurements and predictions to optimize accuracy. 

- If a new measurement carries a significant uncertainty (represented as 𝜎_𝑛 approaching infinity), the final estimate $𝑦_𝑓$ tends towards the prediction $𝑦_𝑝$, effectively disregarding the uncertain measurement. 

- If the prediction exhibits substantial uncertainty due to factors like multiple scattering (indicated by 𝜎𝑝 approaching infinity), the final estimate 𝑦𝑓 leans towards the new measurement 𝑦𝑛, thus prioritizing the more reliable input. To ensure precision, tracking initiates from the end of the track, as proximity to the Interaction Point (IP) typically yields the most accurate measurements. 

This approach offers several advantages, including its iterative nature, low dimensionality, and computational efficiency, with computation time scaling linearly with the number of detector layers. Moreover, the linear approximation requirement only applies locally, facilitating efficient processing without necessitating consistency across the entire track.

    - Provides a more accurate estimate of the trajectory over the entire track.

## Vertices
For precise determination of particle interaction points, the ATLAS detector employs an **iterative vertex finding algorithm**.

This process begins by seeding vertices from the z-positions of reconstructed tracks at the beamline. Subsequently, an iterative 𝜒²-fit is performed based on these initial seeds and nearby tracks. If the tracks deviate significantly, defined as displacement by more than 7 standard deviations (σ), new seeds are generated. This iterative refinement continues until no new seeds are produced. Additionally, the position of the beam-spot serves as a constraint during the vertex finding process. To be considered valid, vertices must involve at least two tracks. 

Achieving spatial resolutions of approximately $23 μm$ in the transverse plane and $40 μm$ in the longitudinal plane, vertices with more than 70 tracks exhibit high precision.

1. **Plots for x, y, and z Coordinates**:
    - These plots show the distribution of events along the x, y, and z axes.
    - **Black Points**: Represent the measured data from the detector.
    - **Dotted Line**: Indicates the beam spot, which is the expected distribution of collision points in the beam.
2. **Comparison of Measured Data to Beam Spot**:
    - **x and y Coordinates**:
        - The measured data closely follows the beam spot distribution.
        - There are slight deviations, indicating potential detector resolution effects or minor misalignments.
    - **z Coordinate**:
        - The z-axis distribution shows a wider spread compared to x and y.
        - This is because the bunch length of the colliding beams is significantly larger along the z-axis, leading to a more extended distribution.


The first of the last 3 plots shows that the $\mu$ expected is 21-23 but the recostruction is lower, make sense because there efficiency.


The second shows:
 - The x-axis represents the number of tracks associated with each reconstructed vertex.
 - The y-axis shows the frequency or number of vertices with a given number of tracks.

    - **Low Track Count Vertices**:
        - Vertices with a low number of tracks are quite common, indicating single or minimal interaction vertices.
        - These vertices typically correspond to primary interactions where fewer particles are produced or detected.
    - **High Track Count Vertices**:
        - As the number of tracks per vertex increases, the frequency of such vertices decreases.
        - High track count vertices often result from multiple interactions (pile-up) or high-multiplicity events where numerous particles are produced.


The graph depicts the vertex reconstruction efficiency in the ATLAS detector as a function of the average number of interactions per bunch crossing (𝜇). It shows how the ability to reconstruct vertices degrades with increasing pile-up (more interactions per event).

- All curves demonstrate a decreasing trend in vertex reconstruction efficiency as 𝜇 increases.
- This is expected, as higher pile-up results in more complex overlapping interactions, making it harder to accurately identify and reconstruct individual vertices.

## Muons
Within the ATLAS detector, four distinct categories of muons are identified based on their detection characteristics and tracking methodologies:

1. **Combined Muons**: Combined muons are identified through a combination of Inner Detector (ID) and Muon Spectrometer (MS) information, along with a full track fit. This method yields the most precise determination of muon trajectories and is predominantly employed for the majority of muons detected within the ATLAS detector.

2. **Standalone Muons**: Muons falling into this category are primarily identified based on information solely from the Muon Spectrometer (MS). They lack associated tracks from the Inner Detector and are often encountered outside the acceptance region (|η| > 2.5) or originate from in-flight decays. 

3. **Segment-tagged Muons**: This group includes muons identified through a combination of Inner Detector (ID) tracking and a single segment of the Muon Spectrometer (MS). Segment-tagged muons are typically associated with low transverse momentum (pT) muons or regions with poor MS coverage.

4. **Calorimeter-tagged Muons:** Muons falling into this category are identified based on Inner Detector (ID) tracks exhibiting Minimum Ionizing Particle (MIP) signatures within the calorimeter.

where the terms r0, r1, r2 describe fluctuations of the energy loss, multiple scattering and intrinsic resolution effects, respectively.

The plot is the invariant mass of the 2 muons. At 90 GeV you expect a bump -> $Z$.

## Electrons
**Recap:** The radiation length is the mean length after which an electron has lost $1/e$ of his energy. 

If $\eta$ is large then the electron get shoot in the beam pipe directions and they see a lot of the beam pipe -> $X_0$ it goes up.

This is what we clearly see in this plot:

## Electron reconstruction

![[Pasted image 20240514113146.png|center|600]]

In the ATLAS detector, the process of identifying energy deposits in the Electromagnetic (EM) calorimeter and associating them with tracks in the Inner Detector involves a three-step procedure:

1. **Cluster Reconstruction**: The initial step involves reconstructing clusters from energy deposits in the EM calorimeter. Seed clusters are formed from energy deposits with a transverse energy (𝐸𝑇) exceeding 2.5 GeV. This is achieved using a sliding-window algorithm with a window size of 3×5 in units of 0.025×0.025 in (η, φ)-space. The efficiency of this process, as determined from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations, ranges from approximately 97% at 𝐸𝑇 = 7 GeV to nearly 100% at 𝐸𝑇 = 20 GeV.

2. **Track Association with Cluster**: Next, tracks from the Inner Detector with transverse momentum (𝑝𝑇) greater than 0.5 GeV are extrapolated to the middle layer of the EM calorimeter. A track is considered matched to a cluster if its pseudorapidity (|η|) and azimuthal angle (|φ|) satisfy |η| < 0.05 and |φ| < 0.1, accounting for the magnetic field's effect on particle trajectories. In cases where multiple tracks are associated with a cluster, priority is given to tracks with more hits and smaller spatial distances (R). If no track is successfully matched to a cluster, the cluster is classified as a candidate for an unconverted photon.

3. **Reconstruction of the Electron**: Following the association of clusters with tracks, the next step involves the reconstruction of electron properties. To optimize the reconstruction, different cluster sizes are utilized based on the detector region: for instance, a size of 3×7 is employed in the barrel region, while 5×5 is used in the endcap region. The total energy estimate of the electron is determined by combining four components: 
	   a. Energy measured in the presampler located in front of the EM calorimeter.
	   b. Energy measured and corrected in the sampling calorimeter, which involves summing the energy over all cluster cells.
	   c. Estimated fraction of energy deposited outside the cluster, known as lateral leakage.
	   d. Estimate of energy deposited beyond the EM calorimeter, referred to as longitudinal leakage. 

   - Corrections for the latter three components are obtained from Monte Carlo (MC) simulations.

   - Additionally, it's crucial to note that the (η, φ) coordinates of the electron are obtained from the matched track at the interaction vertex. However, it's essential to distinguish between detector coordinates and physics coordinates due to potential differences in alignment or calibration between the two coordinate systems.

**Electron identification**
Distinguish prompt electrons in final states of hard-scattering processes (signal) from
	• background including misidentified hadrons,
	• electrons from photon conversion,
	• and non-isolated electrons from heavy-flavor decays.
	• Isolation criteria are based on requirements, separately in ten cluster-η bins and eleven ET bins

Three reference selection criteria used for physics analyses are defined.

• **Loose**: shower-shape variables in first and second layer of EM calorimeter, hadronic leakage information, tracking and matching requirements. High identification efficiency

• **Medium**: Loose plus requirement of hit in innermost layer of pixel detector (reject electrons from photon conversion), requirements of transverse impact parameter |𝑑0|, and identification of transition radiation in the TRT.

• **Tight**: Tighter requirements than medium including a veto on reconstructed photon conversion vertices.

![[Pasted image 20240514113830.png|center|500]]

The efficiency fo loose electros is 100%! In agreement with what is the definition.


## Photons
The identification of photons within the ATLAS detector initiates with electron identification, recognizing that photons can be misidentified as electrons. There are two categories of photons: converted and unconverted. 

For converted photons, the reconstruction process involves identifying tracks resulting from electron-photon conversion. This is achieved through a constrained vertex fit of the two electron tracks, under the assumption of a massless photon. Vertices with only one track may occur at larger radii and are positioned at the first track position. This scenario can arise if the two electrons are very close together or if one track has a transverse momentum (𝑝𝑇) less than 0.5 GeV.

![[Pasted image 20240908133637.png|center|400]]
The next step involves matching clusters of energy deposits in the calorimeter to reconstructed vertices. Unconverted photons are identified as clusters without a corresponding matched vertex. Identification strategies for both converted and unconverted photons vary in quality, akin to those employed for electrons, allowing for nuanced discrimination between signal photons and background sources.
