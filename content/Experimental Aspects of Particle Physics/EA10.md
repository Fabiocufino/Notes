## Particle-Particle Collisions

The diagram illustrating the sequence of events in a particle collision: initial particles, collision point, and resulting particles, with different processes:
	- Incoming beams: parton densities![[Pasted image 20240908122833.png|center|500]]
	- Hard subprocess: described by matrix elements
	- Resonance decay: correlated with hard subprocess
	![[Pasted image 20240519110204.png|center|400]]
	- Inital-state radiation: spacelike parton showers (green)
	- Final-state radiation: timelike parton showers (blue)
	![[Pasted image 20240519110318.png|center|400]]
	- Multi parton-parton interactions with its initial and final radiation
	![[Pasted image 20240519110418.png|center|400]]
	Everything is connected by colour confinement strings.

Here the various components of a simulation: initial state, hard scattering, parton shower, hadronization, underlying event, and detector response

## Reminder: Running Coupling Constant αS
The QCD coupling constant αS changes with the energy scale (momentum transfer  $|q^2|$, leading to different behaviors at short and long distances.
![[Pasted image 20240519110828.png|center|500]]

Graph showing αS as a function of momentum transfer |q^2|. The curve illustrates how αS decreases at high energies (asymptotic freedom) and increases at low energies (confinement).
$$
  \alpha_s(|q^2|) = \frac{\alpha_s(\mu^2)}{1 + \frac{\alpha_s(\mu^2)}{12\pi} (11n - 2f) \ln \left(\frac{|q^2|}{\mu^2}\right)}
  $$
  
  where $n$ is the number of colors, and $f$ is the number of flavors.

## The Factorization Theorem
The total cross-section of a hadron-hadron interaction can be factorized into parton distribution functions and the cross-section of the hard interaction.
$$
  \sigma_{had-had} = \sum_{i,j} \int dx_1 dx_2 f_i(x_1, \mu_F^2) f_j(x_2, \mu_F^2) \hat{\sigma}_{ij}(x_1, x_2, \mu_F^2, \mu_R)
$$
  where $f_i$ and $f_j$ are the parton distribution functions, and $\hat{\sigma}_{ij}$ is the hard interaction cross-section. $\mu_F$ is the factorization scale. There is the hadronization model that is non perturbative. 


**We need models to describe the NON - PERTURBATIVE part of this.**

## Herwig Cluster Model:

Diagram showing the formation of clusters from partons and their subsequent decay into hadrons.
![[Pasted image 20240519114403.png|center|300]]



pre-confinement: In the parton shower cascade, neighboring partons form color-singlet clusters. These clusters decay into two hadrons, which may further 
decay.

- **Features**: Fewer parameters than the Lund string model, implemented in HERWIG and SHERPA generators.
- **Importance**: Explains how partons form color-singlet clusters that decay into hadrons, a key process in event generation. It has less parameters than Lund string model.

The shape of cluster mass distribution: independent of energy

- The shape of the cluster mass distribution is **consistent and similar** across different energy scales QQQ.
- This indicates that the distribution of cluster masses is **independent of the energy scale**.

## Hadronisation (from: Mark Thomson, Modern Particle Physics)
![[Pasted image 20240519114608.png|center|500]]

(i)  quark and anti-quark are produced, initially free
    
(ii)  move apart, colour field a “tube” with large energy density
    
(iii)  move further apart, more energy in colour field ->  colour field breaks if production of new q-anti q pair possible

(iv)  quarks again move further aparts, more quark pairs are created
    
(v)  if energy too low: no further pairs created, particles hadronise (form hadrons) ,→ hadronisation time: O(10−24) sec!

## Lund String Model:

- **Description**: Represents quarks as endpoints and gluons as kinks on a string, with a linear potential $V(r) = \kappa r$ confining them.
- **Features**: Many parameters need tuning using experimental data, implemented in the PYTHIA generator.

- **Visual Description**: Depicts quarks and gluons connected by a string, showing how energy stored in the string leads to hadron formation.![[Pasted image 20240519114827.png|center|200]]

## How do MC modelling uncertainties affect data analyses?

- **Sources of Uncertainty** (non-exhaustive list):
  - Interface between Matrix Element and Parton Shower generators.
  - Color reconnection effects (we have different models)
  - Underlying event (everything that happens that is not the hard process)
  - Initial-state and final-state radiation (ISR/FSR).
  - Parton-shower and hadronization uncertainties.

Reminder: for some parts of the PS we cannot do perturbative calculations, therefore we rely on models! Models: have free parameters: parameters have to be chosen in a reasonable way (see later)

**Example**: Measurement of top quark pair (tt̄) cross-sections.

![[Pasted image 20240519115153.png|center|600]]

**Procedure**:
- Selecting events where both W bosons decay into leptons to minimize uncertainties associated with jets.
- Requirements on leptons: pT > 27 GeV, central part of detector, isolation, etc 
- Requirements on jets: pT >25GeV, central part of the detector, tagged as likely to contain a b-hadron
- process with very small backgrounds, often measured very early in data-taking -> tells us a bit how well we understand the new data (“standard candle”)

**What can we do to reduce these uncertainties?**

- find phase space (specific event selection) where certain uncertainties play less of a role
- find a variable that is less affected by a certain uncertainty
- make auxiliary measurements that allow to constrain parameters of parton shower

**What do we need to make these auxiliary measurements?**
- select events in dataset and calculate the variables sensitive to one or more parameters
- remove detector effects so that result is independent of detector here: rely on “truth” information of the MC generators


*What kind of information do we have?*

![[Pasted image 20240519121608.png|center|600]]

*How far can/may we rely on this truth information?*

**Stable particle level**
- using dressed leptons: generator/model independent
- used e.g. also for jet calibration:
- match the particle-level jet to a reconstructed jet

**Parton level**
- allows to compare with fixed-order calculations as for example done in MCFM
- try to remove hadronization and MPI effects, very model dependent!
- some analyses use these spectra to reweight the MC… always dangerous

---

**Differential cross-section measurements**

- want to test predictions in different parts of phase space
- unfold to parton-level and stable particle level
- allows to compare results from different experiments
- make fiducial measurements
  - allows to test different models
  - helps to constrain systematic uncertainties

**Distributions unfolded to:**
- parton level: top after radiation, but before decay
- particle level: stable leptons and jets clustered from stable particles

---

**Why should we make model-independent measurements?**

When designing an analysis to test only one specific model:
- measurement has very limited lifetime and information
- cannot be reused in a few years, when other models come on the market!

You will never be able to verify a certain model and to exclude all others:
- “All models are wrong, but some are useful” (George Box)

---

**Why doing fiducial measurements?**

**Fiducial volume:**
- define cross-section based on experimental selection and acceptance cuts
  - less model-dependent, since extrapolation to full phase space not needed
  - smaller uncertainties since acceptance corrections not needed
  - best: based on simple kinematic selection cuts: easier to be re-used later
  - MVA used in selection:
    - might have smaller uncertainties, but makes re-use much more difficult

$$
\sigma^{fid}_i = \sum_j A^{th}_{ij} \sigma^{tot}_j
$$

---

**What exactly is unfolding?**

**Problem:**
- want to measure a spectrum (mass, transverse momentum, rapidity...)
- detector has only finite resolution and cannot perfectly measure it
  - distribution will be distorted (different width, shifted) -> So wee need a method that we can use that help us to go from the 'measured' to the reality.

![[Pasted image 20240519122911.png|center|500]]

## Unfolding Techniques

- **Purpose**: Correct observed distributions to remove detector effects and retrieve true distributions.
- **Procedure**:
  - **Response Matrix (R)**: $$
    R_{ij} = \text{Prob(observed in bin } i \text{ | true value in bin } j)
    $$
  - **Efficiency (ε)**: $$
    \epsilon_j = \sum_{i=1}^N R_{ij} = \text{Prob(observed anywhere | true value in bin } j)
    $$
  - **Equation**:    $$
    E[n] = \nu = R\mu + \beta
    $$
### How does this helps us? 
- correct this distribution, to remove the detector effects!
- for this correction: rely on the MC “truth” information
Now we get the unfolded distibution $\mu$ from: 
  $$ 
    \mu =  R^{-1} (\nu - \beta)
  $$
where 𝜈 is the observed distribution and 𝛽 is the background.

**What do we do now with these differential measurements?**

![[Pasted image 20240525110443.png|center|500]]
- Rivet/HEPdata: a special format in which we publish the unfolded measurements, so that they can be used by theorists/other experimentalists

**How to establish realistic systematic uncertainties?**
