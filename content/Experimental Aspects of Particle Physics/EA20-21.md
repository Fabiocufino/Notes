### **Quick Recap of the Euler-Lagrange Equations (Intro)**

The **Euler-Lagrange equation** is a key result in theoretical physics that allows us to derive the equations of motion from a given Lagrangian. It is central to classical mechanics, quantum field theory, and the Standard Model of particle physics.

#### **1. Euler-Lagrange Equation**:

The general form of the Euler-Lagrange equation is:
$$
\frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial \phi} - \frac{d}{dx^\mu} \left( \frac{\partial \mathcal{L}}{\partial (\partial_\mu \phi)} \right) = 0
$$
Where:
- $\mathcal{L}$ is the **Lagrangian density**, which depends on fields and their derivatives.
- $\phi$ is a field, such as a scalar, vector, or spinor field, depending on the system being described.

This equation defines how the field $\phi$ evolves in spacetime according to the dynamics specified by the Lagrangian $\mathcal{L}$. For example, by applying this to the free scalar field, we obtain the **Klein-Gordon equation**.

In the **Standard Model** of particle physics, the Euler-Lagrange equation is used to derive the equations of motion for all the fields in the model (e.g., gauge fields, fermions, Higgs field) and their interactions. The Lagrangian must respect gauge symmetries, leading to the derivation of conservation laws and interaction rules for particles.

### **Problems of the Bare Standard Model**

The **Standard Model (SM)** of particle physics describes the fundamental interactions of particles through the electromagnetic, weak, and strong forces. However, the "bare" version of the Standard Model has significant problems when it comes to generating masses for particles:

#### **1. Lack of Gauge Boson Mass Terms**
- In the Standard Model, the **Lagrangian density** for the gauge bosons does **not contain mass terms**. For instance, the photon, and the $W$ and $Z$ bosons are massless in the original formulation of the SM.
- The electroweak symmetry in the SM is $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, and this symmetry must remain unbroken for the theory to be gauge invariant. This means mass terms like $\frac{1}{2} m^2 A_\mu A^\mu$ (for the photon, for example) are not allowed because they would violate the symmetry.

#### **Exercise**: Show that the Lagrange density cannot contain a mass term for the photon:

1. Apply the gauge transformation to \( A_\mu \):
   $$
   A'_\mu = A_\mu + \frac{1}{e} \partial_\mu \alpha
   $$
   
2. Substitute $A'_\mu$ into the mass term:
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{mass}} = \frac{1}{2} m_\gamma^2 A'_\mu A'^\mu = \frac{1}{2} m_\gamma^2 \left( A_\mu + \frac{1}{e} \partial_\mu \alpha \right) \left( A^\mu + \frac{1}{e} \partial^\mu \alpha \right)
   $$

3. Expand the expression:
   $$
   \mathcal{L}_{\text{mass}} = \frac{1}{2} m_\gamma^2 \left( A_\mu A^\mu + \frac{2}{e} A_\mu \partial^\mu \alpha + \frac{1}{e^2} (\partial_\mu \alpha)(\partial^\mu \alpha) \right)
   $$

   This expansion shows that the mass term after the gauge transformation consists of:
   - The original term $A_\mu A^\mu$, which would be gauge invariant if it stood alone.
   - Two additional terms that depend on the derivative of the gauge transformation parameter $\alpha$. These terms **break gauge invariance** because they introduce explicit dependence on the transformation parameter $\alpha(x)$

#### **2. Fermion Mass Terms**
- The **Lagrangian density** for quarks and leptons in the SM does not include explicit mass terms. This is because the left- and right-handed components of fermions transform differently under the electroweak symmetry $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$.
- A mass term for fermions, of the form $-m_f \bar{\psi} \psi$, would couple the left-handed and right-handed components of the fermion field, which violates the gauge symmetry.

#### **Exercise**: Show that the Lagrangian density for quarks and leptons must not contain mass terms of the form $-m_f \bar{\psi} \psi$:

Under the electroweak gauge group $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$, the left-handed and right-handed fermion fields transform differently:

1. **Left-handed fermions** \( \psi_L \) transform as doublets under \( SU(2)_L \):
   $$
   \psi_L \rightarrow e^{i \alpha^a T^a} \psi_L
   $$
   where $T^a$ are the generators of the $SU(2)_L$ group, and $\alpha^a$ are the transformation parameters.

2. **Right-handed fermions** $\psi_R$ are singlets under $SU(2)_L$, meaning they do not transform under $SU(2)_L$. However, they do transform under $U(1)_Y$ (hypercharge):
   $$
       \psi_R \rightarrow e^{i \beta Y} \psi_R
     $$
   where $Y$ is the hypercharge and $\beta$ is the transformation parameter.
   
### Effect of Gauge Transformations on the Mass Term**
Now, let's see how the mass term transforms under these gauge transformations.
Substituting the transformations into the mass term:
$$
-m_f (\bar{\psi}_L \psi_R + \bar{\psi}_R \psi_L) \rightarrow -m_f \left( \bar{\psi}_L e^{i \beta Y} \psi_R + \bar{\psi}_R e^{i \alpha^a T^a} \psi_L \right)
$$
### **Violation of Gauge Invariance**
In the Standard Model, the left-handed and right-handed fermions transform **differently** under the gauge group $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$. The mass term $-m_f \bar{\psi} \psi$ couples the left- and right-handed components together.

# **Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking**

**Spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB)** is a mechanism in quantum field theory that allows gauge bosons and fermions to acquire masses **without explicitly breaking the gauge symmetries** of the Standard Model.

- In the context of particle physics, **spontaneous symmetry breaking** occurs when the underlying equations of motion (governed by a symmetric Lagrangian) allow for asymmetric solutions, specifically a vacuum state that does not respect the symmetry of the original Lagrangian.

## Calculations

---
---
### **1. Scalar Field Potential and SSB**

Let's consider a **complex scalar field** $\Phi$ with the following Lagrangian:
$$
\mathcal{L} = (\partial_\mu \Phi)^\dagger (\partial^\mu \Phi) - V(\Phi)
$$

The potential $V(\Phi)$ is chosen to exhibit spontaneous symmetry breaking and is of the form:

$$
V(\Phi) = \mu^2 \Phi^\dagger \Phi + \lambda (\Phi^\dagger \Phi)^2
$$
Where:
- $\mu^2$ is a parameter that can be positive or negative.
- $\lambda$ is a positive constant to ensure the potential is bounded from below.

#### **Key Observation:**
- When $\mu^2 > 0$, the minimum of the potential occurs at $\Phi = 0$, corresponding to **no symmetry breaking**.
- When $\mu^2 < 0$, the minimum of the potential occurs at **nonzero values** of $\Phi$ , leading to **spontaneous symmetry breaking**.

### **2. The Mexican Hat Potential (Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking)**

In the case where $\mu^2 < 0$ , the potential takes the shape of a "Mexican hat" or wine bottle, and the field rolls down to a non-zero vacuum expectation value (vev), which spontaneously breaks the symmetry.

The potential can be rewritten as:

$$
V(\Phi) = -|\mu^2| \Phi^\dagger \Phi + \lambda (\Phi^\dagger \Phi)^2
$$

This potential has a **circle of degenerate minima** at:

$$
\langle \Phi \rangle = \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} e^{\theta}
$$
### **3. Choosing the Vacuum Expectation Value (vev)**

We can pick a specific vacuum value for $\Phi$ (since all the points on the circle are equivalent due to symmetry,ex: $\theta = 0$):
$$
\langle \Phi \rangle = \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}}
$$
Where $v = \sqrt{\frac{|\mu^2|}{\lambda}}$ is the vacuum expectation value.

By choosing this particular direction in field space, we **break the symmetry spontaneously**.

### **4. Expanding Around the Vacuum (Reparametrization)**

To study the dynamics of the system after symmetry breaking, we can expand the field $\Phi around the vacuum $\langle \Phi \rangle = \frac{v}{\sqrt{2}} $ as:
- (In reality is a simple parametrization)

$$
\Phi(x) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}}e^{i \frac{\chi(x)}{v}} \left( v + h(x) \right)
$$

Where $h(x)$ is the **Higgs field** (scalar), representing fluctuations around the vacuum, and $\chi(x)$ is the **Goldston boson**

### **5. The New Potential for the Higgs Field**

Substitute $\Phi(x)$ into the original Lagrangian and potential. The new potential in terms of the Higgs field $h(x)$ is:
$$
V(h) = \frac{\lambda}{4} \left( h^2 + 2 v h \right)^2
$$
Expanding this gives:

$$
V(h) = \lambda v^2 h^2 + \lambda v h^3 + \frac{\lambda}{4} h^4
$$
#### **Physical Interpretation**:
- The $h^2$ term corresponds to a **mass term** for the Higgs field.
- The $h^3$ and $h^4$ terms correspond to **self-interactions** of the Higgs boson.

From this, we can read off the **mass of the Higgs boson** \( h \):
$$
m_h^2 = 2 \lambda v^2
$$
Thus, the mass of the Higgs boson depends on the parameters $\lambda$ and $v$ (the vev).

### **6. Gauge Boson Masses via the Higgs Mechanism**
Now, let's couple this scalar field to the gauge fields of the Standard Model. Specifically, in the Standard Model, we consider the **Higgs field** as a **complex doublet** under $SU(2)_L \times U(1)_Y$:

$$
\Phi = \begin{pmatrix} \phi^+ \\ \phi^0 \end{pmatrix}
$$
After spontaneous symmetry breaking:
$$
\Phi = \frac{1}{2}\begin{pmatrix} 0 \\ v + h  \end{pmatrix}
$$
the **gauge bosons** (the \( W \) and \( Z \) bosons) acquire masses by "eating" the unphysical Goldstone bosons.

The masses of the gauge bosons are given by:

$$
m_W = \frac{g v}{2}, \quad m_Z = \frac{\sqrt{g^2 + g'^2} v}{2}
$$

Where $g$ and $g'$ are the coupling constants for the $SU(2)_L$ and $U(1)_Y$ gauge groups, respectively, and $v \approx 246 \, \text{GeV}$ is the vacuum expectation value.

The mass of the Higgs is $m_h = \sqrt{2 \lambda v^2}$

The photon remains massless because the symmetry corresponding to electromagnetism, $U(1)_{\text{em}}$, remains unbroken.

### **7. Fermion Masses via Yukawa Couplings**

The fermions (quarks and leptons) acquire mass through their Yukawa couplings to the Higgs field. The Yukawa interaction Lagrangian for a fermion \( \psi \) is given by:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{Yukawa}} = - y_f \bar{\psi}_L \Phi \psi_R + \text{h.c.}
$$
When the Higgs field acquires its vacuum expectation value, this interaction generates a mass for the fermion:

$$
m_f = y_f v
$$
Where \( y_f \) is the Yukawa coupling constant for the fermion \( f \), and \( v \) is the vacuum expectation value.

## Properties of the Higgs boson

### **Direct Searches at LEP (Large Electron-Positron Collider)**

**Context**:  
LEP was a particle accelerator at CERN that operated from 1989 to 2000, using electron-positron collisions to probe high-energy physics. It provided important constraints on the Higgs boson mass but did not achieve discovery.

**Key Points**:
- **Electron-positron collisions**: LEP collided electrons and positrons, which annihilate to produce a virtual \( Z \) boson. This \( Z \) boson can then produce a real Higgs boson.
- **Higgs production channel**: At LEP, the dominant process was the production of a Higgs boson in association with a \( Z \) boson (\( e^+ e^- \to ZH \)).![[Pasted image 20240905183008.png|center|400]]
- **No discovery at LEP**: LEP was able to rule out a Higgs boson mass below 114 GeV, as no significant signal was observed in that range. ![[Pasted image 20240905183038.png|center|400]]
### **Direct Searches at the Tevatron**

The Tevatron at Fermilab was a proton-antiproton collider that ran until 2011. Like LEP, it played a crucial role in constraining the Higgs boson mass before the LHC.

**Key Points**:
- **Proton-antiproton collisions**: Unlike LEP, which used leptons, the Tevatron used hadrons (protons and antiprotons), which means the collisions involve a mix of quarks and gluons.
- **Search for \( WH \) and \( ZH \)**: The Tevatron focused on Higgs production via associated production, where the Higgs boson is produced alongside a \( W \)- or \( Z \)-boson.
- **Constraints on the Higgs mass**: By combining data from the \( W \)- and \( Z \)-associated channels, the Tevatron ruled out a mass region around 160-170 GeV with high confidence.
![[Pasted image 20240905183154.png|center|500]]
(LEFT) This plot shows the **95% confidence level (C.L.) limits** on the Higgs boson production cross-section at the Tevatron (Run II). The vertical axis shows the limit as a multiple of the Standard Model (SM) Higgs cross-section (denoted as "Limit/SM"), and the horizontal axis shows the possible mass of the Higgs boson (mHm_HmH​) in GeV.


(RIGHT) This plot shows the **best fit** values for the signal strength (denoted as $\sigma \times \text{BR} / \text{SM}$) for different decay channels of the Higgs boson $m_H = 125\, \text{GeV}$, using data from Tevatron Run II. The signal strength is normalized to the Standard Model prediction, so a value of 1 indicates perfect agreement with the SM prediction.


### **Production mechanisms at the LHC**

The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) at CERN is the most powerful particle accelerator, where protons collide at unprecedented energies. Various production mechanisms for the Higgs boson exist at the LHC, each with different cross sections and signatures.

**Key Points**:
- **Four primary production mechanisms**:
  1. **Gluon-gluon fusion (GGF)**: Dominates at the LHC and occurs through loops of heavy quarks, primarily the top quark.
  2. **Vector boson fusion (VBF)**: Involves the exchange of two \( W \)- or \( Z \)-bosons between quarks.
  3. **Associated production with a \( W \)- or \( Z \)-boson (VH)**: A Higgs boson is produced alongside a \( W \)- or \( Z \)-boson.
  4. **Associated production with top quarks (\( t\bar{t}H \))**: A Higgs boson is produced alongside a top quark pair.
![[Pasted image 20240905183616.png|center|400]]

Gluon-Gluon Fusion is the dominant production mode for the Higgs boson at the LHC. It occurs through a quantum loop involving top quarks.

- **Dominant production process**: Around 90% of Higgs bosons at the LHC are produced via gluon-gluon fusion.
- **Top quark loop**: Gluons (the force carriers of the strong force) interact through a loop of virtual top quarks to produce the Higgs boson.
![[Pasted image 20240905184851.png|center|400]]

This plot shows the cross-sections for various **Higgs boson production processes** at the LHC at 7 TeV, plotted against the Higgs mass (\( M_H \)).

**Key Points**:
1. The **vertical axis** represents the cross-section \( \sigma \), measuring the probability of producing a Higgs boson, in picobarns (pb).
2. The **horizontal axis** shows the Higgs mass (\( M_H \)), ranging from 100 to 1000 GeV, illustrating how the cross-section changes with mass.
3. Different colored lines correspond to various production mechanisms:
   - **Gluon-gluon fusion (blue line)**: The dominant process, involving loops of heavy quarks, decreases as the Higgs mass increases.
   - **Vector boson fusion (red line)**: The second most significant process, where two \( W \)- or \( Z \)-bosons fuse to produce the Higgs.
   - **Associated production with \( W \)- or \( Z \)-bosons (green and gray lines)**: These processes are less frequent but still important for studying Higgs properties.
   - **Associated production with top quarks (purple line)**: A rare but critical process for probing the Higgs-top quark interaction.

---

### **Higgs Decay Channels**
Once produced, the Higgs boson can decay into various final states, depending on its mass. At a mass of 125 GeV, it decays predominantly into bottom quarks, but decays to photons and vector bosons are also important.
![[Pasted image 20240905190614.png|center|400]]

**Key Points**:
- **Main decay channels**: 
![[Pasted image 20240905190830.png|center|400]]
  1. **Higgs to fermions**: $H \to b\bar{b}$ is the dominant decay mode for a 125 GeV Higgs.
  2. **Higgs to bosons**: $H \to W^+ W^-$, $H \to ZZ^*$, and $H \to \gamma \gamma$ are important decay modes.
- **Branching ratios**: The relative probability of the Higgs decaying into different particles depends on its mass and the strength of its coupling to other particles.
![[Pasted image 20240905190932.png|center|400]]


---
### **Direct searches at the LHC**

**Context**:  
The Higgs boson was discovered in 2012 by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations at the LHC, with a mass of around 125 GeV.

![[Pasted image 20240905191300.png|center|500]]

**Key Points**:
- **Key decay channels**: The discovery was based on the observation of excess events in the $H \to \gamma \gamma$ $ and $H \to ZZ^*$ channels.
- **Significance**: The combined statistical significance of the Higgs signal exceeded 5 sigma, meaning it was a definitive discovery.
- **Mass measurement**: The mass of the Higgs boson was measured to be around 125 GeV with high precision.

**Picture Explanation**:  
The image likely shows the signal peaks observed by the ATLAS and CMS experiments in the $\gamma \gamma$ and $ZZ^*$ channels, where the Higgs boson manifests as a bump in the invariant mass spectrum of the decay products.


### **Summary of Current Measurements**

**Context**:  
After the discovery, ongoing measurements at the LHC focus on studying the properties of the Higgs boson with increasing precision.

**Key Points**:
- **Precision measurements**: The LHC is measuring the Higgs couplings to gauge bosons, fermions, and its self-coupling to test the Standard Model.
- **Deviations from the Standard Model**: Any deviations from the expected values could be a sign of new physics beyond the Standard Model (BSM).
- **Production and decay modes**: All the production and decay channels discussed earlier are being measured with increasing precision.
