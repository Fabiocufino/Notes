# Indirect searches for new physics – a concrete example

In this lecture is explored the concept of **indirect searches for new physics** through precision measurements and exclusion limits based on Standard Model predictions. 

1. **ATLAS Heavy Particle Searches**:
   - Shows **95% confidence level (CL) exclusion limits** for various hypothetical particles (e.g., supersymmetry).
   - These limits rule out certain mass ranges for new particles, as no significant signals have been observed.

2. **Standard Model Cross Section Measurements**:![[Pasted image 20240905194458.png|center|400]]
   - Presents the **measured cross-sections** for SM processes like $W$-bosons, top quarks, and Higgs bosons across different LHC energies (5.7–14 TeV).
   - Comparing experimental data with theoretical predictions helps validate the SM or reveal possible deviations that could indicate new physics.

4. **Indirect Measurements**:![[Pasted image 20240905194543.png|center|500]]
   - Uses **precision electroweak measurements** (like those from LEP) to constrain properties such as the Higgs mass before direct discovery.
   - These plots show how indirect data were used to predict the Higgs mass, later confirmed by the LHC.

This intro emphasize how **precision measurements** and **exclusion limits** provide crucial constraints on potential new physics, helping to guide searches beyond the Standard Model.


# The EFT approach to new physics

Background:
- **Effective Field Theories (EFTs)** extend the SM Lagrangian by adding higher-dimensional operators that respect Lorentz invariance and SM symmetries.
- **Wilson coefficients** determine the strength of these new operators and are expected to be small. Deviations from the SM would manifest through non-zero Wilson coefficients.
- The EFT framework is particularly useful in sectors like top-quark physics and flavor physics, where deviations from the SM are expected to be more noticeable.

• Extend SM Lagrangian by all possible (and reasonable) operators and interpret deviations from the SM as non-zero strength of these terms
• Long-standing history in such fits in the flavor sector
• Developing in the top-quark sector, e.g. top-photon coupling is interpreted as charge or as anomalous coupling or as Wilson coeffient
• Hope: combine top-quark and flavor measurements to gain sensitivity and strengthen constraints on BSM contributions

### **Historic Example: Fermi's Four-Point Interaction**

- Fermi's theory of weak interactions is a classic **effective field theory** at low energies.
- Before the discovery of the W-boson, weak interactions were described using a four-point interaction model.
- This model is analogous to modern EFTs, where new interactions are treated as effective terms at energies below the BSM energy scale.
![[Pasted image 20240905194906.png|center|500]]

### **EFTs for Top and Bottom Quarks**

- Two key formulations:
    - **SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory)**: Extends the SM by adding higher-dimensional operators that respect the SM symmetries.
    - **WET (Weak Effective Theory)**: Focuses on rare processes like $b \to s+\gamma$, with operators relevant for flavor-changing neutral currents.
### **Effective Field Theories (EFTs) for Top and Bottom Quarks: With Formulas**

In this section, we will evaluate how **Effective Field Theories (EFTs)** are used to probe new physics in the **top and bottom quark sectors**, providing formulas to better understand their application.

---

### **1. SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory)**

The **SMEFT** extends the Standard Model (SM) by including **higher-dimensional operators**. These operators are constructed from SM fields but violate SM symmetries at higher energy scales. The SMEFT Lagrangian can be written as:

$$
\mathcal{L}_{\text{SMEFT}} = \mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}} + \sum_{i} \frac{C_i^{(6)}}{\Lambda^2} O_i^{(6)} + \sum_{j} \frac{C_j^{(8)}}{\Lambda^4} O_j^{(8)} + \dots
$$

- $\mathcal{L}_{\text{SM}}$: Standard Model Lagrangian.
- $O_i^{(6)}$ and $O_j^{(8)}$: Dimension-6 and dimension-8 operators, respectively.
- $C_i^{(6)}$ and $C_j^{(8)}$: Wilson coefficients (parameters that encode the effects of new physics).
- \( \Lambda \): The energy scale at which new physics becomes significant.

These **higher-dimensional operators** are suppressed by powers of $\Lambda$, meaning their effects become more relevant at high energies. SMEFT allows for indirect searches for new physics by constraining the Wilson coefficients using precision measurements.

### **2. WET (Weak Effective Theory)**

**Weak Effective Theory (WET)** is a low-energy EFT that focuses on **flavor-changing neutral currents (FCNCs)** and rare decays, such as \( b \to s + \gamma \).

- Describe rare processes, e.g. $b \to s + \text{photon}$
- Introduce operators $Q_i$ and Wilson coefficients $\bar{C}_i$ which include SM and BSM contributions
- Fermi coupling constant $G_F$ \item CMK-matrix elements

In WET, the Lagrangian for rare B-meson decays is:
$$
  \mathcal{L}_{\text{WET}} = \frac{4G_F}{\sqrt{2}} V_{ts}^* V_{tb} \sum_{i=1}^{8} \bar{C}_i Q_i 
$$
Where:
- $C_i^{(WET)}$ are the Wilson coefficients corresponding to the new physics contributions.



**Energy Scales and Matching**:
![[Pasted image 20240906110601.png|center|400]]

  - SMEFT is applied at high-energy scales, while WET is used at low-energy processes.
  - **Matching** is the process of relating Wilson coefficients in SMEFT to those in WET for consistency when analyzing processes that span different energy scales:
    $$
	    C_i^{\text{WET}} = \sum_j C_j^{\text{SMEFT}} R_{ij}(\mu)
    $$

### **Inference Process: Constraints on Wilson Coefficients**

- **Parameters**: The primary parameters of interest in EFTs are the **Wilson coefficients**, which are constrained by experimental measurements:
  $$
  \tilde{C}_i = \frac{C_i v^2}{\Lambda^2}
  $$
  - These parameters are scaled by the new physics energy scale \( \Lambda \).
  
- **Likelihood**: The probability of obtaining certain measurements, given specific values of the Wilson coefficients, is expressed as the **likelihood**:
  $$
  p(\sigma_{\text{meas}} | \sigma_{\text{pred}}, \tilde{C}_1, \tilde{C}_2)
  $$
  - **Posterior probability** is computed using Bayes' theorem, combining prior knowledge with the likelihood of measurements:
  $$
    p(\tilde{C}_1, \tilde{C}_2 | \sigma_{\text{meas}}) = \frac{p(\sigma_{\text{meas}} | \sigma_{\text{pred}}, \tilde{C}_1, \tilde{C}_2) \cdot p(\tilde{C}_1, \tilde{C}_2)}{\text{Normalization}}
    $$

- Tools like **BAT.jl** (Bayesian Analysis Toolkit in Julia) are used for statistical analysis, including **posterior sampling** for high-dimensional parameter spaces.

### **Example 1: Top-Photon Coupling**

- The coupling between the top quark and the photon is probed by two processes:
![[Pasted image 20240906111149.png|center|500]]
  1. **$b \to s + \gamma$** decays
  2. **$t\bar{t} + \gamma$** production

This slide explains how the **top-quark pair plus photon production** is studied as a function of various EFT parameters. The aim is to explore how new physics (represented by the Wilson coefficients \( \tilde{C} \)) affects the cross-section \( \sigma(t\bar{t}\gamma) \), the production rate of a top-antitop quark pair plus a photon.

### **Key Points:**

1. **Generation of Monte Carlo (MC) Simulations**:
   - The **MadGraph5_aMC@NLO** tool is used to generate Monte Carlo (MC) events. This tool is a framework for simulating particle collisions at next-to-leading order (NLO) in quantum chromodynamics (QCD).
   - The **dim6top_LO UFO model** is used, which includes dimension-6 operators relevant for top quark interactions within the context of SMEFT (Standard Model Effective Field Theory).

2. **Scaling to NLO Predictions**:
   - The Standard Model (SM) prediction is scaled to the **NLO QCD prediction** to account for corrections beyond leading order, which enhances the accuracy of the simulated results.

3. **Interpolation Between Sampling Points**:
   - The simulations are run for various values of the Wilson coefficients \( \tilde{C} \), which are the parameters encoding new physics effects.
   - The resulting cross-sections are interpolated between sampled points to create a smooth curve showing the dependency of \( \sigma(t\bar{t}\gamma) \) on the Wilson coefficients.

4. **Fiducial Acceptance Calculations**:
   - After simulating the events, additional steps such as **parton showering** and **particle-level analysis** are performed with **MadAnalysis**. This includes applying detector acceptance cuts to account for real-world experimental conditions.

### **Plots: Cross-Section $\sigma(t\bar{t}\gamma)$  as a Function of EFT Parameters**

![[Pasted image 20240906120549.png|center|500]]
The three plots at the bottom represent the cross-section $\sigma(t\bar{t}\gamma)$ as a function of different EFT parameters (Wilson coefficients):

1. **Left Plot $\tilde{C}_{uG}$**:
   - This shows the cross-section variation with the Wilson coefficient $\tilde{C}_{uG}$ (representing gluon-top couplings).
   - The x-axis represents the value of $\tilde{C}_{uG}$ , and the y-axis shows the corresponding cross-section.
   - The orange points are results from MC simulations, and the black curve is the interpolation.

2. **Middle Plot $\tilde{C}_{uW}$**:
   - This plot shows how the cross-section depends on the Wilson coefficient $\tilde{C}_{uW}$, which modifies the interaction between the top quark and the W-boson.
   - Similar to the first plot, the black line shows the interpolated values between the simulation points.

3. **Right Plot $\tilde{C}_{uZ}$**:
   - This shows the variation of the cross-section with the Wilson coefficient $\tilde{C}_{uZ}$, related to the interaction between the top quark and the $Z$-boson.
   - The trends and methodology are the same as the other two plots.


Interpretation

- The cross-sections in all three plots show a **parabolic shape**, indicating that the cross-section increases when the Wilson coefficients deviate positively or negatively from zero (the SM prediction). 
- This behavior demonstrates that introducing new physics effects (represented by non-zero \( \tilde{C} \)) increases the likelihood of top-quark pair plus photon production.

### **Branching Ratio as a Function of Wilson Coefficients**
![[Pasted image 20240906120929.png|center|400]]

- **Parameters**: The graph shows the branching ratio as a function of three Wilson coefficients:
  - $\tilde{C}_B$  (red line): Coupling related to new photon interactions.
  - $\tilde{C}_{uG}$ (orange line): Coupling related to gluon interactions.
  - $\tilde{C}_{uW}$ (yellow line): Coupling related to $W$-boson interactions.
  
- **Methodology**:
  - The branching ratio is calculated "by hand" and also using tools like **flavio** (for flavor phenomenology) and **wilson** (for running and matching between different energy scales).
  
- **Results**:
  - The graph shows how the branching ratio $\text{BR}(\bar{B} \to s\gamma)$ changes as these Wilson coefficients deviate from zero (the Standard Model prediction).

---
### **Constraining Parameters** 
![[Pasted image 20240906121037.png|center|300]]

- **Fit Setup**:
  - The fit only includes the branching ratio \( \text{BR}(\bar{B} \to s\gamma) \).
  - A **uniform prior** is applied to the three parameters in the range [-1, 1].
  
- **Results**:
  - The fit shows that there is almost no sensitivity to the parameters $\tilde{C}_{uW}$ and $\tilde{C}_{uG}$ .
  - The posterior for  $\tilde{C}_B$ shows two regions with high probability (visible in the right plot), indicating two likely values for this parameter.



### **Constraining Parameters (Top-Quark Physics Only)**
![[Pasted image 20240906121839.png|center|400]]

- **Fit uses only top-quark cross-sections** $t\bar{t}\gamma$ .
- **Uniform prior** for Wilson coefficients: $\tilde{C}_B$, $\tilde{C}_{uW}$, $\tilde{C}_{uG}$.
- **Top-right plot**: Probability for $\tilde{C}_B$; SM prediction is at $\tilde{C}_B = 0$.
- **Bottom-right plot**: 2D constraint on $\tilde{C}_{uW}$ and $\tilde{C}_{uG}$; confidence region shown by the ellipse. The SM prediction (zero for both parameters) is marked by the black star.

---

### **Constraining Parameters (Combined Analysis)**
![[Pasted image 20240906121903.png|center|300]]

- **Combined fit**: Uses both top-quark and flavor physics data.
- Resolves ambiguity in $\tilde{C}_B$.
- **Orthogonal observables**: Combining observables that probe different parts of the parameter space leads to significantly reduced allowed phase space.
- **Bottom-right plot**: Combined constraints on $\tilde{C}_B$ and $\tilde{C}_{uW}$, showing tighter bounds on the Wilson coefficients. The blue contour represents the allowed region after combining top-quark and $B$-physics data.

---
### **Example 2: Systematic Studies**

- **Correlations**: Correlations between measurements (e.g., systematic uncertainties) have a strong impact on the constraints derived from global fits.
  - **Covariance matrix**: A global covariance matrix accounts for both experimental and theoretical uncertainties.
  - **Parameterization**: Systematic and theoretical uncertainties are parameterized by correlation parameters $\rho_{\text{sys}}$ and $\rho_{\text{th}}$
  
- **Scenarios**: The study considers different levels of correlation:
  - No correlation $\rho_{\text{sys}} = \rho_{\text{th}} = 0$
  - Best guess $\rho_{\text{sys}} = \rho_{\text{th}} = 0.9$ 
  - Variation $\rho_{\text{sys}} = 0 \dots 0.9$

---

### **Example 3: Toward a Global Fit**

- The goal is to combine data from multiple sources (top-quark, bottom-quark, and $Z$-boson sectors) for a **global fit** of Wilson coefficients.
  
- **Scenarios**:
  1. **Current measurements**: Using current LHC and other data to constrain Wilson coefficients.
  2. **Near-future experiments**: HL-LHC and Belle II measurements are expected to tighten the constraints.
  3. **Future collider experiments** (e.g., CLIC) could provide even more sensitive constraints.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **Global Fits**: Combining data from different sectors (top and bottom quarks) provides significantly stronger constraints on new physics.
- **Next Steps**: Further global fits, including charm-quark processes and precision measurements from future experiments (e.g., FCC-ee), are needed to fully explore the parameter space and further constrain BSM contributions.
