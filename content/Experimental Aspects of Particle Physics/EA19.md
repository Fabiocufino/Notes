## Example: Measurement of W boson mass

To calculate the branching ratios (BR) for the decays of the $W^-$ boson, let's break it down.

### 1. **Possible Decay Channels**
The $W^-$ boson is a mediator of the weak force and can decay into a pair of fermions, specifically:
- A lepton and its corresponding neutrino (leptonic decays).
- A quark and an antiquark (hadronic decays).

#### Leptonic Decays
The possible leptonic decays of \( W^- \) are:
- $W^- \rightarrow e^- + \bar{\nu}_e$
- $W^- \rightarrow \mu^- + \bar{\nu}_\mu$
- $W^- \rightarrow \tau^- + \bar{\nu}_\tau$

Each of these decay modes is equally probable for leptons, and since there are 3 leptonic channels, each one contributes \(\frac{1}{9}\) to the total branching ratio (considering the total decay including quarks).

#### Hadronic Decays
The hadronic decays are:
- $W^+ \rightarrow u \bar{d}$
- $W^+ \rightarrow c \bar{s}$
- $W^+ \rightarrow u \bar{s}$
- $W^+ \rightarrow c \bar{d}$
	
The possible quark combinations are based on the CKM matrix, which governs the mixing between quark generations. Since there are 6 types of quarks, you can pair up quarks and antiquarks in different combinations, with some decay modes being more probable than others due to the CKM elements.

### 2. **Branching Ratios (BR)**
The branching ratio is calculated as the ratio of the partial width for a specific decay channel to the total decay width of the $W^-$ boson.
$$
BR = \frac{\Gamma(W^- \rightarrow X)}{\Gamma_{\text{total}}(W^-)}
$$

For leptonic decays, the contribution of each channel is roughly:

$$
BR_{\text{leptonic}} = \frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3} \quad \text{(since 3 leptonic flavors and each flavor is equally probable)}
$$

For hadronic decays, using CKM matrix elements and the fact that there are two possible quarks for each channel (up-type and down-type), the hadronic branching ratio can be computed similarly. Approximately, about \( \sim67\% \) of \( W^- \) decays are hadronic, and \( \sim33\% \) are leptonic.

### 3. **Final States Consideration**
When considering initial and final state particles for the $W^-$:
- **Initial State**: $W^-$ is a spin-1 boson with a negative electric charge.
- **Final State**: You need to ensure that:
  - The total charge of the final state particles sums to -1.
  - The spin of the final state particles should combine to match the spin of the \( W^- \) boson.
  - Color is not a concern for leptonic decays, but for hadronic decays, the quark and antiquark should form a color-neutral combination.

**What is produced more often at LHC?**
In a proton-proton pp collider like the LHC, $W^+$ bosons are produced more often than $W^-$ bosons 

This is because protons consist of two up quarks and one down quark, and interactions that produce $W$ bosons typically involve quarks and antiquarks. For example, an up quark and an anti-down quark can produce a $W^+$, while a down quark and an anti-up quark can produce a $W^-$. Due to the quark content of protons, there is an asymmetry that favors the production of $W^+$ bosons over $W^-$.

So, the correct answer here is **\(W^+\) bosons** are produced more often at the LHC.

## Measurement of the W boson mass

Precise measurements of the W boson mass need to account for these higher-order quantum corrections:
![[Pasted image 20240905121231.png|center|400]]

The W boson's mass depends on many factors, including the Z boson's mass, the electromagnetic coupling, and loop corrections from the interactions of the W with other heavy particles. These corrections are crucial for achieving agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements of the W boson mass.
![[Pasted image 20240905121252.png|center|400]]


**Propagator self-energy corrections** to the \( W \)-boson mass: how these corrections depend on the masses of heavy particles in the Standard Model, namely the top quark and the Higgs boson.

### The Formula:
$$
\Delta \rho_{\text{se}} = \frac{3 G_F m_W^2}{8 \sqrt{2} \pi^2} \left[ \frac{m_{\text{top}}^2}{m_W^2} - \frac{\sin^2 \theta_W}{\cos^2 \theta_W} \left( \ln \frac{m_H^2}{m_W^2} - \frac{5}{6} \right) + \dots \right]
$$

This formula represents the **self-energy corrections** to the \( W \)-boson propagator, specifically the parameter \( \Delta \rho \), which captures the effects of heavy particle loops (such as the top quark and Higgs boson) on the \( W \)-boson mass.

### Key Takeaways:

1. **Top Quark Contribution (Quadratic Dependence):**
   - The first term $\frac{m_{\text{top}}^2}{m_W^2}$ shows that the corrections to the \( W \)-boson mass depend **quadratically** on the **top quark mass**.

2. **Higgs Boson Contribution (Logarithmic Dependence):**
   - The second term involves the **logarithmic dependence** on the **Higgs boson mass** $\ln \frac{m_H^2}{m_W^2}$.

# Hadronic Recoil $u_T$
The hadronic recoil is crucial in events where a neutrino is involved because it provides additional information to help reconstruct the full event.
![[Pasted image 20240905121824.png|center|400]]

The diagram illustrates the event topology of a WWW-boson decay in a detector. It shows how the different components of the event are related to the hadronic recoil and the missing transverse energy


**Hadronic Recoil (green arrow):**

- The hadronic recoil is the response of the rest of the event, caused by the hadronic remnants (quarks and gluons) from the initial proton-proton collision. These remnants form jets, which are detected and contribute to the hadronic recoil.
- The total transverse momentum of the hadronic recoil can be written as: $\vec{u}_T = \sum_i \vec{E}_{T,i}$ where the sum runs over all calorimeter clusters not associated with the electron. This captures the recoil effect of the hadronic activity.


![[Pasted image 20240905122155.png|center|500]]

# Uncertainties 
**Key Uncertainties in WWW-Boson Measurements**:
- **Initial State Radiation (ISR)**: Gluons radiated from the quarks in the initial state (proton-proton collision) can affect the WWW-boson kinematics, making it difficult to model the transverse momentum of the WWW-boson.
   
- **Final State Radiation (FSR)**: Photons radiated from the final-state charged lepton can alter the distribution of the transverse mass. This effect is particularly problematic when reconstructing the WWW-boson’s momentum.
  
- **Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs)**: The momentum distributions of quarks and gluons inside protons (described by PDFs) need to be accurately modelled. Small uncertainties in PDFs can lead to shifts in the reconstructed WWW-boson mass.

### **Improving Precision Using Z Boson Events**

Z boson decays provide a clean and well-understood process, which can be used to tune the simulation of WWW-boson events. Z events are used to:

- **Calibrate the detector**: The known properties of the Z boson allow for precise calibration of energy and momentum scales in the detector.
- **Improve QCD Modelling**: Since the Z boson production mechanism is similar to that of the W-boson, tuning the QCD simulations (particularly for ISR and FSR) using Z events can improve the modelling of W-boson events.


*Brief reminder: what is MC “tuning”?*
	**Monte Carlo (MC) tuning** is the process of adjusting the parameters of a Monte Carlo event generator so that the simulated data better matches the real experimental data. This is critical for accurately modeling particle collisions, particularly for processes involving complex QCD interactions like parton showers and hadronization.

**How to achieve high precision: use Z boson events**
![[Pasted image 20240905123529.png|center|500]]

**Why do we need to be careful with extrapolation of results?**

We need to be careful with **extrapolation of results** because conclusions drawn from one dataset or experimental condition might not hold true in a different context or phase space. Extrapolation involves predicting outcomes outside the range of the available data, and this can lead to inaccuracies if the underlying assumptions or conditions change significantly.

### Real-World Example (From the Slides):

- The slide uses the analogy of **Lionel Messi’s football performance** to illustrate the dangers of extrapolation:
    - Messi’s **goals-per-game ratio** in the Spanish league was always above 0.79, so one might **extrapolate** that he would score at least 3 goals in 4 World Cup matches.
    - However, the **World Cup is a very different phase space**—the competition is different, the stakes are higher, and conditions are less predictable. In reality, Messi scored only 1 goal in 4 matches, showing that the extrapolation was inaccurate.

This example demonstrates that extrapolating performance in one domain (the Spanish league) to another domain (the World Cup) can lead to incorrect conclusions because the underlying conditions are different.


## Final Results of WWW-Boson Mass Measurement**

After applying the discussed techniques and controlling for uncertainties, the W-boson mass was measured with the following precision:

$$m_W = 80,369.5 \pm 6.8 \text{ MeV (stat)} \pm 10.6 \text{ MeV (exp)} \pm 13.6 \text{ MeV (model)}$$
This results in a total uncertainty of approximately 18.5 MeV, which corresponds to a relative uncertainty of 0.023%. The total uncertainty is dominated by QCD modeling and parton distribution function uncertainties.

**Top-quark mass measurement** 
### **1. Importance of the Top-Quark Mass in the Standard Model (SM)**
The top quark is the heaviest known elementary particle in the Standard Model, and its mass plays a crucial role in multiple areas of theoretical and experimental physics:

Fermion coupling to the Higgs boson:
![[Pasted image 20240905124506.png|center|400]]
Why need precision measurements? 
- fundamental parameter of the standard model  
- test if the higgs potential is stable/meta-stable  
- “MC mass” within ≈ few hundred MeV – 1 GeV of pole mass

**What different ways are there to measure mtop?**
- “direct” reconstruction methods at detector level
	- binned/unbinned template methods
	- matrix-element methods
	- ideogram method
- differential σ(tt) cross-section: unfolded distributions
- differential σ(tt+1jet) cross-section: unfolded distributions
We will see one example of category 'direct'

What do I need for this measurement?
![[Pasted image 20240905125440.png|center|500]]

### **Top-Quark Pair Production**
Top quarks are primarily produced in pairs at the LHC through two main processes:
- **$q\bar{q}$-annihilation**: Quarks from the colliding protons annihilate, producing a top-antitop pair.
- **Gluon-gluon fusion**: Gluons from the colliding protons fuse to produce the top-antitop pair.
![[Pasted image 20240905125804.png|center|300]]

The relative contribution of these processes depends on the center-of-mass energy of the collider. At the LHC, **gluon-gluon fusion dominates** at higher energies (13 TeV).

### **3. Top-Quark Decay Channels**
How can we identify Top-Quark pairs? Top-Quark Decay:

Top-Quark Decay:
![[Pasted image 20240905130106.png|center|300]]
#### Decay Channels:
1. **Dilepton channel:
   - Final state: two leptons (electrons or muons), two neutrinos, and two b-jets.
   - **Pro**: Clean signal with little background.
   - **Con**: Kinematically under-constrained due to the presence of two neutrinos, which escape detection.

2. **Lepton + jets channel**
   - Final state: one lepton, one neutrino, two \( b \)-jets, and two light-quark jets.
   - **Pro**: Good signal-to-background ratio.
   - **Con**: Sensitive to uncertainties in jet reconstruction and modeling.

3. **All-hadronic channel** (\( t\bar{t} \to q \bar{q}^\prime b \bar{q} q^\prime \bar{b} \)):
   - Final state: six jets (including two \( b \)-jets).
   - **Pro**: Largest branching ratio, so the most common.
   - **Con**: Large background from QCD multijet production, making it difficult to isolate the signal.
![[Pasted image 20240905130021.png|center|300]]

#### Ideal for Top-Quark Mass Measurement:

The **lepton + jets channel** is often used for top-quark mass measurements because it provides a good balance between signal purity and background contamination, while also being kinematically well-defined.
![[Pasted image 20240905130228.png|center|400]]

**How does the signal process look like?**
![[Pasted image 20240905130251.png|center|400]]
![[Pasted image 20240905130310.png|center|400]]
- expect 4 jets ⇒ 24 possible jet-quark assignments (permutations)  
- pick one for calculation of variables ⇒ use kinematic fit to find best permutation
![[Pasted image 20240905130402.png|center|400]]
Remember for later: the best permutation is not always correct.

After event reconstruction: obtain mass templates![[Pasted image 20240905130435.png|center|400]]
- Extract top-quark mass from unbinned likelihood fit of templates to data.

---

#### **(1) Template Method**
- This is the most commonly used method.
- **Procedure**:
    1. Reconstruct the top-quark mass for each event by calculating the invariant mass of the decay products.
    2. Create **mass templates** (histograms) from MC simulations for different hypothesized values of \( m_{\text{top}} \).
    3. Perform a **fit** to the data using these templates to determine the value of \( m_{\text{top}} \) that best matches the data.

### **Systematic Uncertainties in Top-Quark Mass Measurement**
The precision of top-quark mass measurements is limited by systematic uncertainties, which often dominate over statistical uncertainties. Some of the key sources of systematic uncertainty include:

- **Jet Energy Scale (JES)**:
    - The uncertainty in the calibration of the jet energy scale affects the measured top-quark mass because jets are used to reconstruct the top and \( W \)-boson masses. JES is one of the largest sources of systematic uncertainty.

- **b-Jet Energy Scale (bJES)**:
    - The calibration of \( b \)-jets is particularly important, as \( b \)-jets are used in the top-quark mass reconstruction. The relative energy scale between \( b \)-jets and light-quark jets introduces an additional source of uncertainty.

- **QCD Initial and Final State Radiation (ISR/FSR)**:
    - Radiation emitted by quarks and gluons before and after the hard scattering event can change the momentum of the reconstructed jets, thus affecting the measured mass. This uncertainty is particularly difficult to model, especially in the non-perturbative regime.

- **Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs)**:
    - The uncertainty in the proton’s parton distribution functions affects the kinematics of the event, particularly the transverse momentum distribution of the top-quark pair system.

### **8. Final Top-Quark Mass Results**
The top-quark mass has been measured with increasing precision over the years. The combination of different methods and datasets has led to the most precise value of $m_{\text{top}}$:
![[Pasted image 20240905162539.png|center|400]]
This corresponds to a total uncertainty of approximately 0.28%, making it one of the most precisely measured parameters in the Standard Model.

### **9. Future Directions for Top-Quark Mass Measurement**

- increase cut on jet pT → reduce impact of JES uncertainties  
- remove potential double-counting between JES and modelling uncertainties reduce systematic uncertainties such as flavour composition and response

- perform differential measurements:  
	→ significant improvement in data modelling and reduction of uncertainties
