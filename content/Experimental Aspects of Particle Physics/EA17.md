How experimentalists work with the SM (or any other model):

1. Measurement of the modelâ€™s free parameters
	- Finite set, some are difficult to measure

2. Comparison of the predictions of the model with measurements
	- Huge variety of measurements possible
	- A lot of different techniques, colliders, experiments, observables, etc.

3. Global consistency tests
	- Combine all measurements (including their correlation) and compare to the model
	- Several fitting tools on the market
	- Sometimes focus on particular aspects, e.g. EFTs, Higgs, etc.
  
Experimental approaches to validate the Standard Model can be categorized into direct searches, rare decay measurements, and precision measurements. Direct searches involve looking for rare production processes, such as single-top quark plus photon production or di-Higgs production. Rare decay measurements focus on decays with small branching ratios, such as $B_s \to \mu^+ \mu^-$. Precision measurements, on the other hand, aim to accurately determine Standard Model parameters like particle masses, production cross-sections, and asymmetries.


Precision measurements are crucial and require a comprehensive understanding of the detector model, accelerator parameters, and systematic uncertainties. Theoretical predictions must be precise, often necessitating next-to-next-to-leading-order QCD calculations and their implementation in Monte Carlo generators. Lepton colliders, such as LEP and SLC, provide excellent control over the initial state, while hadron colliders like the Tevatron and LHC offer higher center-of-mass energy and greater luminosity.

## LEP and SLC Experiments

The LEP collider at CERN, a circular collider with unpolarized electrons and positrons, reached center-of-mass energies up to 209 GeV. It hosted four major experiments: ALEPH, DELPHI, OPAL, and L3.

The SLC collider at SLAC, a linear collider with polarized electrons and positrons (80% polarization), operated at a center-of-mass energy of about 90 GeV. It hosted a single experiment, SLD.

Compilations of precision measurements from groups such as the LEP electroweak working group, SLD electroweak heavy flavor group, and Tevatron electroweak working group are essential for comparing experimental data with Standard Model predictions. Tools like S-Fitter, Gfitter, and ZFITTER are used to interpret these measurement.

The above graph illustrates the cross-section of electron-positron annihilation into hadrons as a function of the center-of-mass energy. The peak at around 91 GeV corresponds to the Z boson resonance, indicating the energy where the Z boson production is maximal. This peak is prominently covered by experiments like SLC and LEP I. The graph also shows the data from various other colliders, including CESR, DORIS, PEP, PETRA, TRISTAN, and KEKB, contributing to the detailed understanding of electroweak processes.

## Observables and Measurements

Observables sensitive to different features and parameters of the Standard Model can be derived from the Lagrangian and the resulting cross-sections and decay widths. Common observables at the Z-pole include $M_Z$, $\Gamma_Z$, partial decay widths into fermions, and various asymmetry variables.

## Gfitter

Gfitter is a software tool designed for fitting electroweak observables to precision data. Its first publication detailed its methodology and application to data from LEP, SLC, Tevatron, and LHC. Theoretical predictions and statistical treatments are integral to its function. The tool provides input values and fit results for various observables and parameters, facilitating the global electroweak fit.
