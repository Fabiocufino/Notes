# Measurement of Cross Sections in Particle Physics

**Introduction:**
Understanding and measuring cross-sections is a fundamental aspect of experimental particle physics. Cross-sections allow us to quantify the likelihood of various particle interactions, providing a bridge between theoretical predictions and experimental observations.

**Motivation and Importance of Cross Sections:**
Cross-sections are crucial in several domains:
- **Cosmic Radiation:** High-energy particles from space interact with the Earth's atmosphere, creating showers of secondary particles. Understanding the cross-sections of these interactions helps in studying cosmic rays and their effects.
- **Proton Therapy:** In medical applications, particularly in cancer treatment, protons are used to target tumors. Knowledge of proton interaction cross-sections at different energies ensures accurate dosage calculations, minimizing damage to healthy tissue.
- **Search for New Physics:** Measuring cross-sections at particle colliders, like the LHC, helps in searching for new particles and phenomena beyond the Standard Model.

**Definition of a Cross Section:**
The cross section, denoted by $\sigma$, is defined as:
$$
\sigma = \frac{\text{Number of interactions per particle and unit time}}{\text{Flux}}
$$
In simpler terms, it represents the effective area that a target particle presents to an incoming particle. The unit of cross-section is the barn ($1 \text{ barn} = 10^{-24} \text{ cm}^2$).

**Fermi's Golden Rule in Quantum Mechanics:**
Fermi's Golden Rule is essential for calculating transition rates in quantum systems:
$$
\Gamma_{fi} = 2\pi |T_{fi}|^2 \rho(E_i)
$$
where:
- $\Gamma_{fi}$ is the transition rate from initial state $|i\rangle$ to final state $|f\rangle$,
- $T_{fi}$ is the transition matrix element,
- $\rho(E_i)$ is the density of states at energy $E_i$.

**Scattering of Two Particles:**
In a particle collision, initial particles with momenta $p_1$ and $p_2$ interact, producing $n$ final state particles with momenta $p_3, \ldots, p_{n+2}$ 

This can be described as:
$$
p_1 + p_2 \rightarrow p_3 + \cdots + p_{n+2}
$$

**Relativistic Form of Fermi's Golden Rule:**
For high-energy particle interactions, the differential cross-section in the relativistic form is given by:

$$
d\sigma = \frac{2\pi |M|^2}{4 |\mathbf{p_1}| |\mathbf{p_2}|} \frac{d\Phi_n(p_1 + p_2; p_3, \ldots, p_{n+2})}{|\mathbf{p_1} \cdot \mathbf{p_2}|}
$$
where:
- $M$ is the matrix element,
- Flux factor in the center-of-mass frame:
   $$
   \sqrt{(p_1 \cdot p_2)^2 - m_1^2 m_2^2} = p_{1,\text{cm}} \cdot \sqrt{s}
   $$
- Lorentz-invariant phase space:
   $$
   d\Phi_n(p_1 + p_2; p_3, \ldots, p_{n+2}) = \delta^4(p_1 + p_2 - \sum_{i=3}^{n+2} p_i) \prod_{i=3}^{n+2} \frac{d^3 p_i}{(2\pi)^3 2E_i}
   $$

**Example of 2 -> 2 Scattering:**
Consider a simple 2 to 2 scattering process, such as electron-photon scattering. The differential cross-section is:
$$
d\sigma = \frac{1}{64\pi^2 s} \frac{|\mathbf{p_f}^*|}{|\mathbf{p_i}^*|} \int |M|^2 d\Omega^*
$$
where:
- $s$ is the Mandelstam variable,
- $|\mathbf{p_f}^*|$ and $|\mathbf{p_i}^*|$ are the momenta in the center-of-mass frame,
- $d\Omega^*$ is the differential solid angle.

**Measurement of a Cross Section:**
The number of expected events $\nu$ observed in an experiment is proportional to several factors:
$$
\nu = L_{\text{int}} \cdot \sigma \cdot A \cdot \epsilon
$$
where:
- $L_{\text{int}}$ is the integrated luminosity, a measure of the total number of collisions,
- $\sigma$ is the cross-section,
- $A$ is the acceptance, accounting for the geometric and detector acceptance,
- $\epsilon$ is the efficiency of detecting the event.

The number of observed events $N$ can be used to estimate the number of expected events by subtracting the background $N_{\text{bkg}}$:
$$
\nu \approx N - N_{\text{bkg}}
$$
This formula relates the theory (cross section σ) with the experiment (A, ε) and the analyst (N).

**Luminosity:**
Luminosity ($L$) is a measure of the collision rate in a particle collider and is given by:
$$
L = \frac{n_1 n_2 f}{4\pi \sigma_x \sigma_y}
$$
where:
- $n_1$ and $n_2$ are the number of particles in the colliding bunches,
- $f$ is the collision frequency,
- $\sigma_x, \sigma_y$ are the transverse sizes of the beams.

-> Integrated Luminosity: 
$$
L_{int} = \int L dt
$$

**Efficiencies and Acceptances:**
- **Acceptance ($A$):** Represents the fraction of the solid angle covered by the detector. In an ideal detector, this would be $4\pi$ steradians, but practical considerations such as  Beam pipe, Detector feet, Cables, pipes, Iron yoke (magnet) reduce this.
- **Efficiency ($\epsilon$):** The probability that a particle produced in an interaction is detected. This accounts for detector performance, data acquisition dead times, and reconstruction algorithms.

**Example: Muon Reconstruction Efficiency:**
Figure below shows the muon reconstruction efficiency as a function of the pseudorapidity $\eta$. Notable down picks correspond to regions where the detector's efficiency is lower due to physical obstructions or other limitations.

**Cross Section Calculations:**
To calculate cross sections from theoretical models, one often uses Feynman diagrams to represent particle interactions. For instance, in the process $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$, the cross section can be calculated using the following steps:
1. Write down the amplitude $\mathcal{M}$ using Feynman rules.
2. Compute the squared amplitude $|\mathcal{M}|^2$.
3. Integrate over the appropriate phase space to obtain the cross section.

For example, the differential cross section for $e^+e^- \rightarrow \mu^+\mu^-$ is computed as follows:
![[Pasted image 20240908181211.png|center|600]]
where $\alpha$ is the fine-structure constant, $s$ is the center-of-mass energy squared, and $\theta$ is the scattering angle.

**Exercise: compute the total cross section**

For the total cross section:
1. **Start with the given differential cross section:**
   $$
	\frac{d\sigma}{d\Omega} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4s}(1 + \cos^2\theta)
   $$
2. **Integrate over the solid angle \(d\Omega = \sin\theta \, d\theta \, d\phi\):**
   - The integration over \(\phi\) gives a factor of \(2\pi\).
   - The remaining integral over \(\theta\) is split into two parts: $$
     \int_0^{\pi} (1 + \cos^2\theta) \sin\theta \, d\theta = 2 + \frac{2}{3} = \frac{8}{3}
     $$
3. **Combine the results:**
   Multiply everything together:
   $$
   \sigma_{\text{total}} = \frac{\alpha^2}{4s} \cdot 2\pi \cdot \frac{8}{3} = \frac{2\pi\alpha^2}{3s}
   $$

The plot compares the differential cross section for $e^+ e^- \to \mu^+ \mu^-$ between experimental data and theoretical predictions. The dashed line represents pure QED (photon exchange only), while the solid line includes both QED and Z-boson exchange. The data shows better agreement with the full model (QED + Z-exchange), demonstrating the importance of including Z-boson contributions at this energy level to accurately describe the process.

**Proton-Proton Collisions and Factorization:**
In proton-proton collisions, the observed cross-section factorizes into parton distribution functions (PDFs) and a hard scattering cross-section:
$$
\sigma_{pp \rightarrow X} = \sum_{ij} \int dx_i \, dx_j \, f_i(x_i, \mu_F) \, f_j(x_j, \mu_F) \, \hat{\sigma}_{ij \rightarrow X}(\alpha_S, \mu_R, Q^2, \mu_F, \mu_R)
$$
where:
- $f_i$ and $f_j$ are the PDFs for partons $i$ and $j$,
- $\hat{\sigma}$ is the partonic cross-section.

**Parton Distribution Functions (PDFs):**
PDFs describe the probability of finding a parton with a certain momentum fraction $x$ inside the proton. They are universal and determined experimentally. The shape of PDFs varies with the momentum transfer $Q^2$ due to QCD evolution.

**Exercise: Top-Quark Pair Production:**
Consider the production of top-quark pairs ($t\bar{t}$) in proton-proton collisions.
![[Pasted image 20240908182002.png|center|400]]
- At leading order, the dominant mechanism for producing top-quark pairs in high-energy proton collisions, like those at the LHC, is **gluon-gluon fusion**. This is due to the following reasons:
	- **Gluon Density Dominance**: In a proton, gluons are the most abundant partons at small xxx values. The xxx-value is the fraction of the proton's momentum carried by the partons, and for producing heavy particles like the top quark (which has a mass of approximately 175 GeV), the required xxx is relatively small (about 0.027 for $\sqrt{s} = 13 \, \text{TeV}$).

The minimum value of $x$ needed to produce a $t\bar{t}$ pair at the LHC with $\sqrt{s} = 13 \text{ TeV}$ is:
$$
x_{\text{min}} = \frac{2m_t}{\sqrt{s}} \approx \frac{2 \times 175 \text{ GeV}}{13 \text{ TeV}} \approx 0.027
$$
Here, gluon-gluon fusion dominates the production due to the higher density of gluons at small $x$ values compared to quarks.

**Event Displays:**
Event displays are graphical representations of the data collected in particle detectors. They provide insights into the types of particles produced and their kinematics. For instance:
- **Higgs to 2 Muons Event:** Displays two high-momentum muons consistent with Higgs boson decay.
- **Di-Jet Event with $m_{jj} = 9.3 \text{ TeV}$:** Shows a high invariant mass event, indicative of a high-energy process.![[Pasted image 20240608143253.png|center|400]]
- **Z to 2 Muons Event:** Shows a typical $Z$ boson decay into two muons.![[Pasted image 20240608143205.png|center|400]]
